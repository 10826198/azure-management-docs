# Link your partner ID to enable partner earned credit on delegated resources

If you're a member of the [Microsoft Partner Network](https://partner.microsoft.com/), you can link your partner ID with the credentials used to manage delegated customer resources. This lets you track your impact across customer engagements and receive [partner earned credit for managed services (PEC)](/partner-center/partner-earned-credit).

If you onboard customers through Managed Service offers to Azure Marketplace, this link happens automatically, using the MPN ID associated with the Partner Center account used to publish the offers.

If you onboard customers by using Azure Resource Management templates, you'll need to take action to create this link. This is done by associating your MPN ID with at least one user account in your managing tenant that has access to each of your onboarded subscriptions.
