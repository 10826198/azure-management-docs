# Remove access to a delegation

This article explains how you, as a service provider, can remove access to a subscription or resource group that was previously delegated to Azure delegated resource management.

By default, users in the customer's tenant who have the appropriate permissions can remove service provider access to delegated resources in the [Service providers page](view-manage-service-providers.md#add-or-remove-service-provider-offers) of the Azure portal. When they do so, no users in the service provider's tenant will be able to access the resources that had been previously delegated.

If you have onboarded users with the [Managed Services Registration Assignment Delete Role](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#managed-services-registration-assignment-delete-role) when onboarding a customer for Azure delegated resource management, those users will also be able to remove the delegation.

> [!TIP]
> We recommend assigning the [Managed Services Registration Assignment Delete Role](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#managed-services-registration-assignment-delete-role) when onboarding a customer, so that users in your tenant can [remove access to the delegation](#remove-access-to-a-delegation) later if needed. If this role is not assigned, delegated resources can only be removed by a user in the customer's tenant.

The example below shows an assignment granting the **Managed Services Registration Assignment Delete Role** that can be included in a parameter file:

```json
    "authorizations": [ 
        { 
            "principalId": "cfa7496e-a619-4a14-a740-85c5ad2063bb", 
            "principalIdDisplayName": "MSP Operators", 
            "roleDefinitionId": "91c1777a-f3dc-4fae-b103-61d183457e46" 
        } 
    ] 
```

A user with this permission can remove a delegation in one of the following ways.

### Azure portal

1. Navigate to the [My customers page](view-manage-customers.md).
2. Select **Delegations**.
3. Find the delegation you want to remove, then select the trash can icon that appears in its row.

### PowerShell

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Log in first with Connect-AzAccount if you're not using Cloud Shell

# Sign in as a user from the managing tenant directory 

Login-AzAccount

# Select the subscription that is delegated - or contains the delegated resource group(s)

Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionName "<subscriptionName>"

# Get the registration assignment

Get-AzManagedServicesAssignment -Scope "/subscriptions/{delegatedSubscriptionId}"

# Delete the registration assignment

Remove-AzManagedServicesAssignment -ResourceId "/subscriptions/{delegatedSubscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.ManagedServices/registrationAssignments/{assignmentGuid}"
```

### Azure CLI

```azurecli-interactive
# Log in first with az login if you're not using Cloud Shell

# Sign in as a user from the managing tenant directory

az login

# Select the subscription that is delegated â€“ or contains the delegated resource group(s)

az account set -s <subscriptionId/name>

# List registration assignments

az managedservices assignment list

# Delete the registration assignment

az managedservices assignment delete --assignment <id or full resourceId>
```
