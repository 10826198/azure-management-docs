# Use an Azure managed identity in ACR Tasks 

Enable a [managed identity for Azure resources](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md) in an ACR task, so the task can access other Azure resources, without needing to provide or manage credentials in code. For example, use a managed identity to pull or push container images to another registry as a step in a task.

In this article, you learn more about managed identities and how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Enable a managed identity on an ACR task
> * Grant the identity access to Azure resources, such as another Azure container registry or an Azure key vault
> * Use the managed identity to access the resources from a task 

To create the Azure resources, this article requires that you run the Azure CLI version 2.0.66 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli].

## Why use a managed identity?

A managed identity for Azure resources provides Azure services with an automatically managed identity in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). You can configure [certain Azure resources](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/services-support-managed-identities.md), including ACR Tasks, with a managed identity. Then, use the identity to access other Azure resources, without passing credentials in code or scripts.

Managed identities are of two types:

* *User-assigned identities*, which you can assign to multiple resources and persist for as long as you want. User-assigned identities are currently in preview.

* A *system-managed identity*, which is unique to a specific resource such as an ACR task and lasts for the lifetime of that resource.

After you set up an Azure resource with a managed identity, grant the identity access to another resource, just like any security principal. For example, assign a managed identity a role with pull, push and pull, or other permissions to a private container registry in Azure. (For a complete list of registry roles, see [Azure Container Registry roles and permissions](container-registry-roles.md).) You can give an identity access to one or more resources.

The task examples in this article enable a system-managed identity, which gets created automatically and persists for the lifetime of the task. If you want to use a user-assigned identity, first [create an identity](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-manage-ua-identity-portal.md) using the Azure portal or other tools.

## Create container registries

For this article, you need two Azure container registries:

* You use the first registry to create and execute ACR tasks. In this article, this registry is named *myregistry*. 
* The second registry hosts a base image used for the first example task to build an image. In this article, the second registry is named *mybaseregistry*.

Replace with your own registry names in later steps.

If you don't already have the needed Azure container registries, see [Quickstart: Create a private container registry using the Azure CLI](container-registry-get-started-azure-cli.md). You don't need to push images to the registry yet.

The second example requires a private repository in Docker Hub, and a Docker Hub account with permissions to write to the repo. In this example, this repo is named *hubuser/hubrepo*. 

## Example: Task that references a base image, requiring permissions

This example task requires pulling a base image from another registry to build and push an application image. In a real-world scenario, an organization might maintain a set of base images used by all development teams to build their applications. These base images are stored in a corporate registry, with each development team having only pull rights.

### Prepare base registry

First, create a working directory and then create a file named Dockerfile with the following content. This simple example builds a Node.js base image from a public image in Docker Hub.
    
```bash
echo FROM node:9-alpine > Dockerfile
```
In the current directory, run the [az acr build][az-acr-build] command to build and push the base image to the base registry. In practice, another team or process in the organization might maintain the base registry.
    
```azurecli
az acr build --image baseimages/node:9-alpine --registry mybaseregistry --file .
```

### Create task with a system-assigned identity

Create a [multi-step task](container-registry-tasks-multi-step.md) in the first registry and enable a system-assigned identity.

The steps for this example task are defined in a [YAML file](container-registry-tasks-reference-yaml.md). Create a file named `helloworldtask.yaml` in your local working directory and paste in the following contents. Update the value of `REGISTRY_NAME` in the build step with the server name of your base registry.

```yml
version: v1.0.0
steps:
# Replace mybaseregistry with the name of your registry containing the base image
  - build: -t {{.Run.Registry}}/hello-world:{{.Run.ID}}  https://github.com/Azure-Samples/acr-build-helloworld-node.git -f Dockerfile-app --build-arg REGISTRY_NAME=mybaseregistry.azurecr.io
  - push: ["{{.Run.Registry}}/hello-world:{{.Run.ID}}"]
```

The build step uses the `Dockerfile-app` file in the [Azure-Samples/acr-build-helloworld-node](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/acr-build-helloworld-node.git) to build an image. The `--build-arg` references the base registry to pull the base image. When successfully built, the image is pushed to the registry used to run the task.

Create the task *helloworldtask* by executing the following [az acr task create][az-acr-task-create] command. The task context is the local system, and the command references the file `helloworldtask.yaml` in the working directory. The `--assign-identity` parameter with no additional value creates a system-assigned identity for the task. This task is set up so you have to trigger it manually. 

```azurecli
az acr task create \
  --registry myregistry \
  --name helloworldtask \
  --context /dev/null \
  --file helloworldtask.yaml \
  --commit-trigger-enabled false \
  --pull-request-trigger-enabled false \
  --assign-identity
```

In the command output, the `identity` section shows an identity of type `SystemAssigned` is set in the task. The `principalId` is the service principal ID of the identity:

```console
[...]
  "identity": {
    "principalId": "xxxxxxxx-2703-42f9-97d0-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "tenantId": "xxxxxxxx-86f1-41af-91ab-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "type": "SystemAssigned",
    "userAssignedIdentities": null
  },
  "location": "eastus",
[...]
``` 

Use the [az acr task show][az-acr-task-show] command to store the `principalId` in a variable, to use in later commands:

```azurecli
principalID=$(az acr task show --name helloworldtask --registry myregistry --query identity.principalId --output tsv)
```

### Give identity pull permissions to the base registry

In this section, give the system-assigned identity permissions to pull from the base registry, *mybaseregistry*.

First use the [az acr show][az-acr-show] command to get the resource ID of the base registry and store it in a variable:

```azurecli
basereg_id=$(az acr show --name mybaseregistry --query id --output tsv)
```

Use the [az role assignment create][az-role-assignment-create] command to assign the identity the `acrpull` role to the base registry. This role has permissions only to pull images from the registry.

```azurecli
az role assignment create --assignee $principalID --scope $basereg_id --role acrpull
```

### Add target registry credentials to task

Now use the [az acr task credential add][az-acr-task-credential-add] command to add the identity's credentials to the task so that it can authenticate with the base registry.

```azurecli
az acr task credential add \
  --name helloworldtask \
  --registry myregistry \
  --login-server mybaseregistry.azurecr.io \
  --use-identity [system]
```

### Manually run the task

Use the [az acr task run][az-acr-task-run] command to manually trigger the task. 

```azurecli
az acr task run \
  --name helloworldtask \
  --registry myregistry
```

If the task runs successfully, output is similar to:

Run the [az acr repository show-tags][az-acr-repository-show-tags] command to verify that the image built and was successfully pushed to *myregistry*:

```azurecli
az acr repository show-tags --name myregistry --repository hello-world --output tsv
```

Example output:

```console

```

## Example: Use Azure Key Vault to store credentials for Docker Hub

In this example, you enable a system-assigned identity with permissions to read Docker Hub credentials stored in an Azure key vault. The credentials are for a Docker Hub account with write (push) permissions to a private repository in Docker Hub. The task associated with the identity builds an image, and signs into Docker Hub to push the image to the private repo. In a real-world scenario, a company might publish images to a private repo in Docker Hub as part of a build process. 

### Create a key vault and store a secret

First, if you need to, create a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location with the following [az group create][az-group-create] command:

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

Use the [az keyvault create][az-keyvault-create] command to create a key vault. Be sure to specify a unique key vault name. 

```azurecli-interactive
az keyvault create --name mykeyvault --resource-group myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

Store the required Docker Hub credentials in the key vault using the [az keyvault secret set][az-keyvault-secret-set] command. In these commands, the values are passed in environment variables:

```azurecli
# Store Docker Hub user name
az keyvault secret set \
  --name UserName \
  --value $USERNAME \
  --vault-name mykeyvault

# Store Docker Hub password
az keyvault secret set \
  --name Password \
  --value $PASSWORD \
  --vault-name mykeyvault
```

In a real-world scenario, secrets would likely be set and maintained in a separate process.

### Create task with system-assigned identity

The steps for this example task are defined in a [YAML file](container-registry-tasks-reference-yaml.md). Create a file named `dockerhubtask.yaml` in a local working directory and paste the following contents. Be sure to replace the key vault name in the file with the name of your key vault.

```yml
version: v1.0.0
# Replace mykeyvault with the name of your key vault
secrets:
  - id: username
    keyvault: https://mykeyvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/UserName
  - id: password
    keyvault: https://mykeyvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/Password
steps:
# Log in to Docker Hub
  - cmd: docker login --username '{{.Secrets.username}}' --password '{{.Secrets.password}}'
# Build image
  - build: -t {{.Values.PrivateRepo}}:{{.Run.ID}} https://github.com/Azure-Samples/acr-tasks.git -f hello-world.dockerfile
# Push image to private repo in Docker Hub
  - push:
    - {{.Values.PrivateRepo}}:{{.Run.ID}}
```

The task steps do the following:

* Manage secret credentials to authenticate with Docker Hub.
* Authenticate with Docker Hub by passing the secrets to the `docker login` command.
* Build an image using a sample Dockerfile in the [Azure-Samples/acr-tasks](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/acr-tasks.git) repo.
* Push the image to the private Docker Hub repository.

Create a task by executing the following [az acr task create][az-acr-task-create] command. The task context is the local system, and the command references the file `dockerhubtask.yaml` in the working directory. The `--assign-identity` parameter with no additional value creates a system-assigned identity for the task. This task is set up so you have to trigger it manually.

```azurecli
az acr task create \
  --name dockerhubtask \
  --registry myregistry \
  --context /dev/null \
  --file dockerhubtask.yaml \
  --pull-request-trigger-enabled false \
  --commit-trigger-enabled false \
  --assign-identity
```

In the command output, the `identity` section shows an identity of type `SystemAssigned` is set in the task. The `principalId` is the service principal ID of the identity:

```console
[...]
  "identity": {
    "principalId": "xxxxxxxx-2703-42f9-97d0-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "tenantId": "xxxxxxxx-86f1-41af-91ab-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "type": "SystemAssigned",
    "userAssignedIdentities": null
  },
  "location": "eastus",
[...]
``` 

Use the [az acr task show][az-acr-task-show] command to store the principalId in a variable, to use in later commands:

```azurecli
principalID=$(az acr task show --name dockerhubtask --registry myregistry --query identity.principalId --output tsv)
```

### Grant identity access to key vault to read secret

Run the following [az keyvault set-policy][az-keyvault-set-policy] command to set an access policy on the key vault. The following example allows the identity to get secrets from the key vault. 

```azurecli
az keyvault set-policy --name mykeyvault --resource-group myResourceGroup --object-id $principalID --secret-permissions get
```

### Manually run the task

Use the [az acr task run][az-acr-task-run] command to manually trigger the task. The `--set` parameter is used to pass the private repo name to the task. In this example, the placeholder repo name is *hubuser/hubrepo*.

```azurecli
az acr task run --name dockerhubtask --registry myregistry --set PrivateRepo=hubuser/hubrepo 
```

When the task runs successfully, output shows successful authentication to Docker Hub, and the image is successfully built and pushed to the private repo:
