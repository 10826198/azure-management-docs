# Tutorial: Deploy the Connected registry Arc extension with HTTPS

The Connected registry extension deployment can be secured with HTTPS, TLS encryption, and inherent trust distribution.

The Connected registry is a managed service that enables customers to securely manage and access containerized workloads across multiple locations, including on-premises and remote sites. The Connected registry integrates with Azure Arc, providing a unified lifecycle management experience for Kubernetes-based containerized workloads.

Follow the [quickstart][quickstart] to create an Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster. Deploying Secure-by-default settings imply the following configuration is being used: HTTPS, Read Only, Trust Distribution, Cert Manager service.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need:

* Create or use an existing Azure Container Registry (ACR) with [quickstart.][create-acr]

* Set up the firewall access and communication between the ACR registry and the Connected registry by enabling the [dedicated data endpoints.][dedicated data endpoints]

* Create or use an existing Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with the [tutorial.][tutorial-aks-cluster]

* Set up the connection between the Kubernetes cluster and Azure Arc by following the [quickstart.][quickstart-connect-cluster]

* Set up the [Azure CLI][Install Azure CLI] to connect to Azure and Kubernetes.

* Use the [k8s-extension][k8s-extension] command to manage Kubernetes extensions.

    ```azurecli
    az extension add --name k8s-extension
    ```
* Register the required [Azure resource providers][azure-resource-provider-requirements] in your subscription and use Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes:

    ```azurecli
    az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Kubernetes
    az provider register --namespace Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration
    ```
    An Azure resource provider is a set of REST operations that enable functionality for a specific Azure service. 

* Follow the [quickstart][quickstart] to create an Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster. Apply Secure-by-default settings imply the following configuration is being used: HTTPS, Read Only, Trust Distribution, Cert Manager service. 

## Deploy Connected registry extension with HTTPS (TLS encryption)

While using a preinstalled cert-manager service on the cluster, you can deploy the Connected registry extension with HTTPS (TLS encryption) by following the steps:

1. Run the [az-k8s-extension-create][az-k8s-extension-create] command in the [quickstart][quickstart] and set the `cert-manager.enabled=true` and `cert-manager.install=false` parameters to determine the cert-manager service is installed and enabled:

    ```azurecli
    az k8s-extension create --cluster-name myarck8scluster \ 
    --cluster-type connectedClusters \ 
    --extension-type Microsoft.ContainerRegistry.ConnectedRegistry \ 
    --name myconnectedregistry \ 
    --resource-group myresourcegroup \ 
    --config service.clusterIP=192.100.100.1 trustDistribution.enabled=true trustDistribution.skipNodeSelector=true cert-manager.enabled=true cert-manager.install=false \ 
    --config-protected-file protected-settings-extension.json 
    ```

## Deploy Connected registry with kubernetes secret management for TLS encryption 

Follow the [quickstart][quickstart] and add the Kubernetes TLS secret string variable + value pair. 

1. Protected settings file example with secret in JSON format: 

    ```json
    { 
    
    # TLS settings 
    
    tls: 
    
    secret: “k8secret” 
    
    } 
    ```

Now, you can deploy the Connected registry extension with HTTPS (TLS encryption) using the kubernetes secret management by configuring variables set to `cert-manager.enabled=false` and `cert-manager.install=false`. With these parameters, the cert-manager isn't installed or enabled since the kubernetes secret is used instead for encryption.  

2. Run the [az-k8s-extension-create][az-k8s-extension-create] command for deployment after protected settings file is edited:

    ```azurecli
    az k8s-extension create --cluster-name myarck8scluster \
    --cluster-type connectedClusters \  
    --extension-type  Microsoft.ContainerRegistry.ConnectedRegistry \ 
    --name myconnectedregistry \ 
    --resource-group myresourcegroup \
    --config service.clusterIP=192.100.100.1  trustDistribution.enabled=true 
          trustDistribution.skipNodeSelector=true cert-manager.enabled=false cert-manager.install=false \ 
    --config-protected-file protected-settings-extension.json 
    ```

## Deploy Connected registry extension using Bring Your Own Certificate (BYOC) for TLS encryption

Follow the [quickstart][quickstart] and add the public certificate and private key string variable + value pair. 

1. Protected settings file example with secret in JSON format: 

> [!NOTE]
> The public certificate and private key pair must be encoded in base64 format and added to the protected settings file.
    
```json
        { 
        
        # TLS settings 
        
        tls: 
        
        crt: "public-cert"
              key: "private-key"
        
        } 
```

2. Now, you can deploy the Connected registry extension with HTTPS (TLS encryption) using the public certificate and private key pair management by configuring variables set to `cert-manager.enabled=false` and `cert-manager.install=false`. With these parameters, the cert-manager isn't installed or enabled since the public certificate and private key pair is used instead for encryption.  

3. Run the [az-k8s-extension-create][az-k8s-extension-create] command for deployment after protected settings file is edited:

    ```azurecli
    az k8s-extension create --cluster-name myarck8scluster \
    --cluster-type connectedClusters \  
    --extension-type  Microsoft.ContainerRegistry.ConnectedRegistry \ 
    --name myconnectedregistry \ 
    --resource-group myresourcegroup \
    --config service.clusterIP=192.100.100.1  trustDistribution.enabled=true trustDistribution.skipNodeSelector=true cert-manager.enabled=false cert-manager.install=false \ 
    --config-protected-file protected-settings-extension.json 
    ```

## Deploy the Connected registry Arc extension with inherent trust distribution and reject Connected registry trust distribution

While using your own kubernetes secret or public certificate and private key pairs, you can deploy the Connected registry extension with HTTPS (TLS encryption), inherent trust distribution, and reject Connected registry trust distribution.

1. Follow the [quickstart][quickstart] to add either the Kubernetes secret or public certificate, and private key variable + value pairs in the protected settings file in JSON format.

2. Run the [az-k8s-extension-create][az-k8s-extension-create] command in [quickstart][quickstart] and set the `trustDistribution.enabled=false`, `trustDistribution.skipNodeSelector=false` parameters to reject Connected registry trust distribution:
    
    ```azurecli
    az k8s-extension create --cluster-name myarck8scluster \ 
    --cluster-type connectedClusters \ 
    --extension-type Microsoft.ContainerRegistry.ConnectedRegistry \ 
    --name myconnectedregistry \ 
    --resource-group myresourcegroup \ 
    --config service.clusterIP==192.100.100.1 trustDistribution.enabled=false trustDistribution.skipNodeSelector=false cert-manager.enabled=false cert-manager.install=false \ 
    --config-protected-file <JSON file path> 
    ```

With these parameters, cert-manager isn't installed or enabled, additionally, the Connected registry trust distribution isn't enforced. Instead you're using the cluster provided trust distribution for establishing trust between the Connected registry and the client nodes.

## Deploy the Connected registry Arc extension with HTTP (no TLS encryption)

The Connected registry extension deployment can be further secured with HTTP and no TLS encryption.

1. Follow the [quickstart][quickstart], and edit the [az-k8s-extension-create][az-k8s-extension-create] command with`add httpsEnabled=false`. You must also set both `cert-manager.enabled` and `cert-manager.install` values to false. These parameters disable TLS encryption and cert-manager. However trust must establish between the Connected registry nodes and the client nodes.  

    ```azurecli
    az k8s-extension create --cluster-name myarck8scluster 
    --cluster-type connectedClusters \  
    --extension-type  Microsoft.ContainerRegistry.ConnectedRegistry \ 
    --name myconnectedregistry \ 
    --resource-group myresourcegroup \
    --config service.clusterIP=192.100.100.1 trustDistribution.enabled=true trustDistribution.skipNodeSelector=true cert-manager.enabled=false cert-manager.install=false HttpsEnabled=false \ 
    --config-protected-file <JSON file path>
    ```

## Clean up resources

By deleting the deployed Connected registry extension, you remove the corresponding Connected registry pods and configuration settings.   

1. Run the [az-k8s-extension-delete][az-k8s-extension-delete] command to delete the Connected registry extension:

    ```azurecli
    az k8s-extension delete --name myconnectedregistry 
    --cluster-name myarcakscluster \ 
    --resource-group myresourcegroup \ 
    --cluster-type connectedClusters
    ```   

2. Run the [az acr connected-registry delete][az-acr-connected-registry-delete] command to delete the Connected registry:

    ```azurecli
    az acr connected-registry delete 
    --name myarcakscluster \ 
    --resource-group myresourcegroup
    ```
By deleting the Connected registry extension and the Connected registry, you remove all the associated resources and configurations.
