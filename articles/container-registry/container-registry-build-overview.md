# Automate OS and framework patching with ACR Build

As containers provide new levels of virtualization, isolating application and developer dependencies from the infrastructure and operational requirements, we must address how the application virtualization is patched.

## What is ACR Build?

Azure Container Registry Build is an Azure-native container build service. As a feature of Azure Container Registry, ACR Build enables inner-loop development in the cloud with the [Quick Build](container-registry-tutorial-quick-build.md), as well as automated container image building.

ACR Build supports triggering container image builds automatically when code is committed to a Git repository, and when a container's base image is updated. With base image update triggers, you can automate your OS and application framework patching workflow, maintaining secure environments, while adhering to the principals of immutable containers.

## Quick Build: inner-loop extended to the cloud

The beginning of lifecycle management starts before developers check-in their first lines of code. ACR Build enables an integrated local, inner-loop development experience, offloading builds to Azure. Developers can verify their automated build definitions, prior to checking in their code. Using the familiar docker build format, `az acr build` will take a local context, send it to the acr build service, optionally pushing to its registry upon completion. ACR Build will follow your geo-replicated registries, enabling dispersed development teams to leverage the closest replicated datacenter. For preview, ACR build service will support East US and West Europe.

ACR Build was designed as a container lifecycle primitive, that will extend and/or integrate into your CI/CD solution.
Using `az login` with [a service principal
](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest#log-in-with-a-service-principal), your CI/CD solution may call `az acr build [...]` commands.

## Automated build: source code commit

Feature description.

## Automated build: base image update

ACR Build dynamically discovers base image dependencies. During preview, base images are limited to the same registry.
