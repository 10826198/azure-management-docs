# Allow trusted services to securely access a network-restricted container registry

Azure Container Registry supports select trusted Azure services to access a network-restricted container registry. When a registry allows access by trusted services, a managed identity enabled in a trusted service instance can securely bypass the registry's network rules. To pull or push images to the registry, the identity must be assigned an RBAC role and authenticate with the registry.

Modifying settings for access by trusted services is a feature of the **Premium** service tier. For information about registry service tiers and limits, see [Azure Container Registry service tiers](container-registry-skus.md).

You can use the Azure Cloud Shell or a local installation of the Azure CLI to run the command examples in this article. If you'd like to use it locally, version **XXXX** or later is required. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Why allow trusted services?

Azure Container Registry has a layered security model, supporting multiple network configurations that restrict access to a registry, including:

* [Private endpoint with Azure Private Link](container-registry-private-link.md). When configured, a registry's private endpoint is accessible only to resources within the virtual network, using private IP addresses.  
* [Registry firewall rules](container-registry-access-selected-networks.md), which allow access to the registry's public endpoint only from specific public IP addresses or address ranges. You can also use the firewall to block all access through the public endpoint when using private endpoints.

A user or service attempting to access a registry from outside those sources will be denied access. Several managed Azure services operate from networks that can't be included in registry network settings, preventing them from pulling images for certain scenarios. By allowing trusted services, a registry owner can enable select trusted Azure resources to securely bypass network restrictions placed on a registry. 

## Limitations

* Only a system-assigned managed identity enabled in a [trusted service](#trusted-services) instance can access a network-restricted container registry. User-assigned managed identities aren't currently supported.
* Allowing trusted services is only effective in container registries that are restricted with a [private endpoint](container-registry-private-link.md) or that have [public IP access rules](container-registry-access-selected-networks.md) applied. This feature isn't supported in a registry configured with a [service endpoint](container-registry-vnet.md).

## Trusted services

The following services are allowed to access a network-restricted container registry when the registry's **network rule bypass options** setting is enabled (the default). More services will be added over time.

|Trusted service  |Supported usage scenarios  |
|---------|---------|
|ACR Tasks     | [Access a different registry from an ACR Task](container-registry-tasks-cross-registry-authentication.md)       |
|Machine Learning | [Deploy](../machine-learning/how-to-deploy-custom-docker-image.md) or [train](../machine-learning/how-to-train-with-custom-image.md) a model in a Machine Learning workspace using a custom Docker container image |
|Azure Container Registry | [Import images from another Azure container registry](container-registry-import-images.md#import-from-another-azure-container-registry) | 

### Non-trusted services

Instances of the following managed Azure services are *not* allowed access to a network-restricted Azure container registry, and access isn't enabled at this time by enabling network rule bypass options:

* Azure Security Center
* Container Instances
* App Service

## Disable or enable network rule bypass options - CLI

By default, the network rule bypass options setting is enabled in new Azure container registries. Disable or enable the setting by running the [az acr update](/cli/azure/acr#az-acr-update) command.

To disable:

```azurecli
az acr update --name myregistry --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --network-rule-bypass-options disabled
```

To enable:

```azurecli
az acr update --name myregistry --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --network-rule-bypass-options enabled
```

## Trusted services workflow

Here is a typical workflow to enable an instance of a trusted service to bypass network restrictions in a container registry.

1. Enable a system-assigned [managed identity for Azure resources](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md) in an instance of one of the [trusted services](#trusted-services) for Azure Container Registry.
1. Give the identity [RBAC permissions](container-registry-roles.md) to your registry, for example the ACRPull role to pull container images.
1. In the network-restricted registry, ensure that the network rule bypass options setting is enabled. 
1. Use the identity's credentials to authenticate with the network-restricted registry. 
1. Perform permitted registry operations using the managed identity.

## Example: ACR Tasks

The following example demonstrates ACR Tasks as a trusted service in a network-restricted Azure container registry. See [Cross-registry authentication in an ACR task using an Azure-managed identity](container-registry-tasks-cross-registry-authentication.md) for task details.

1. Create or update an Azure container registry, and [push a base image](container-registry-tasks-cross-registry-authentication.md#prepare-base-registry) to the registry. This registry is the *base registry* for the scenario.
1. In a second Azure container registry, [define](container-registry-tasks-cross-registry-authentication.md#define-task-steps-in-yaml-file) and [create](container-registry-tasks-cross-registry-authentication.md#option-2-create-task-with-system-assigned-identity) an ACR task to pull an image from the base registry. Enable a system-assigned managed identity when creating the task.
1. Grant the identity [permissions to access the base registry](container-registry-tasks-authentication-managed-identity.md#3-grant-the-identity-permissions-to-access-other-azure-resources). For example, assign the AcrPull role, with permissions to pull images.
1. [Add managed identity credentials](container-registry-tasks-authentication-managed-identity.md#4-optional-add-credentials-to-the-task) to the task.
1. To confirm that the task bypasses network restrictions, [disable public access](container-registry-access-selected-networks.md#disable-public-network-access) in the base registry.
1. Run the task. If the base registry and task are configured properly, the task runs successfully.
