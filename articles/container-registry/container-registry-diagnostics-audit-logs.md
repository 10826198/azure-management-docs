# Azure Container Registry logs for diagnostic evaluation and auditing

This article explains how to monitor an Azure container registry using features of [Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/overview.md). Azure Monitor collects [diagnostic logs](../azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-logs-overview.md) for user-driven events in your registry. Collect and consume this data in a variety of ways to:

* Audit configuration changes to a registry to ensure security and compliance 

* Provide a complete activity trail on registry artifacts such as pull, push, and delete events so you can diagnose any issues with operation of your registry. 

> [!NOTE]
> You may incur additional costs to store or process diagnostic log data.

## Registry diagnostic logs

Diagnostic logs contain information emitted by Azure resources that describe the operation of each resource. For an Azure container registry, the logs include the following kinds of events and data. Log data is stored in the **RegistryEvents** table.

* **User operations** on registry artifacts or ACR tasks. Examples include push, pull, delete, untag, quarantine, content trust, and related operations for container images. For these operations, log data includes:
  * Success and failure events
  * Start and end time stamps
  * Registry login account and account type, including assignment of roles and permissions
* **Registry network configuration** 

Custom views prefixed with **ACR** show data scoped to subsets of registry events. For example, the **ACRDelete** view shows events related to deleting tags, manifests, or repositories. 

## Enable collection of diagnostic logs

Collection of diagnostic logs for a container registry is not enabled by default. Explicitly enable diagnostic settings for each registry you want to monitor. To view log information in near real-time in Azure Monitor, enable *streaming* of diagnostic logs to a Log Analytics workspace. 

To stream to Log Analytics, first create a workspace using the [Azure portal](../azure-monitor/learn/quick-create-workspace.md) or other Azure tools. Then, set up log streaming programmatically, via the portal, or using the Azure Monitor REST APIs. In each method, you create a diagnostic setting in which you specify a Log Analytics workspace and the log categories and metrics you want to send in to that workspace. For details, see [Stream Azure Diagnostic Logs to Log Analytics workspace in Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-logs-stream-log-store.md).

The following screenshot shows creation of a diagnostic setting for a registry using the portal.

After enabling this diagnostic setting, view and analyze diagnostic logs in Azure Monitor. After you enable streaming of diagnostic logs to Log Analytics, view the logs in Azure Monitor under the **Logs** tab.

Several default queries are enabled. To create your own log queries, see [Get started with log queries in Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/log-query/get-started-queries.md).
 
### Additional log destinations

In addition to streaming the logs to Log Analytics, or as an alternative, a common scenario is to select an Azure Storage account as a destination to archive logs. To archive logs in Azure Storage, create the account before enabling archiving through the diagnostic settings.

You can also stream diagnostic log events to an [Azure Event Hub](../event-hubs/event-hubs-what-is-event-hubs.md). Event Hubs can ingest millions of events per second, which you can then transform and store using any real-time analytics provider.
