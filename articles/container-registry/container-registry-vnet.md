# Deploy an Azure container registry in an Azure virtual network

[Azure Virtual Network](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md) provides secure, private networking including filtering, routing, and peering for your Azure and on-premises resources. By deploying your private Azure container registry into an Azure virtual network, you can ensure that only resources in the virtual network are able to communicate with the container registry.

Azure resources in the virtual network such as an [Azure Kubernetes Service](../aks/intro-kubernetes.md) cluster or a [virtual machine]() configured as a Docker host can securely connect to the container registry to pull or push container images without crossing a network boundary.

This article shows you how to use a virtual machine deployed in a virtual network to access a container registry in the same network.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is currently in preview, and some [limitations apply](#preview-limitations). Previews are made available to you on the condition that you agree to the [supplemental terms of use][terms-of-use]. Some aspects of this feature may change prior to general availability (GA).

## Virtual network deployment limitations

Certain limitations apply when you deploy a container registry to a virtual network.

* Currently, only the following resources can access a container registry in a properly configured virtual network: Azure AKS cluster, Azure virtual machine. Azure Container Instances are not supported.
* The container registry and virtual network must be in the same Azure region.
* In preview, only the following regions support container registries in virtual networks: West Central US, ...
* [Other limitations - registry SKUs?]

## Prerequisites

This article assumes you will use a Docker-enabled virtual machine in a virtual network to access an Azure container registry. If you already have a virtual machine, you can skip the first step to create the virtual machine in a virtual network.

## Create a Docker-enabled virtual machine

First, create a resource group to contain the virtual machine and virtual network. Create a resource group with [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az_group_create). The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *westcentralus* location:

```azurecli
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location westcentralus
```

Now deploy a default Ubuntu Azure virtual machine  with [az vm create][az-vm-create]. The following example creates a VM named *myDockerVM*:

```azurecli
az vm create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myDockerVM \
    --image UbuntuLTS \
    --admin-username azureuser \
    --generate-ssh-keys
```

It takes a few minutes for the VM to be created. When the VM has been created, take note of the `publicIpAddress` displayed by the Azure CLI. Use this address to make SSH connections to the VM.


### Install Docker

After the VM is running, make an SSH connection to the public IP address of the VM. When the connection is established, run the following command to install Docker:

```bash
sudo apt install docker.io -y
```

After installation, run the following command to verify that Docker is running properly on the VM:

```bash
sudo docker run -it hello-world
```

## Add a service endpoint to the virtual network

When you create a VM, Azure automatically creates a virtual network in the same resource group. The name of the virtual network is based on the name of the virtual machine. For example, if you named your virtual machine *myDockerVM*, the virtual network is named *myDockerVMVNET*, with a subnet named *myDockerVMSubnet*. Verify this either in the Azure portal or with the [az network vnet list][az-network-vnet-list] command:

```azurecli
az network vnet list -g myResourceGroup --query "[].{Name: name, Subnet: subnets[0].name}"
```

Output:

```console
[
  {
    "Name": "myDockerVMVNET",
    "Subnet": "myDockerVMSubnet"
  }
]
```

Now add a service endpoint for Azure Container Registry to your virtual network and subnet. A [service endpoint](../virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview.md) in Azure represents a range of IP addresses in Azure regions that make resources for an Azure service available only from a virtual network. Traffic from your virtual network to the Azure service always remains on the Microsoft Azure backbone network.

Use the [az network vnet subnet update][az-network-vnet-subnet-update] command to add a **Microsoft.ContainerRegistry** service endpoint to your virtual network and subnet. Substitute the names of your virtual network and subnet in the following command:

```azurecli
az network vnet subnet update \
  --name myDockerVMSubnet \
  --vnet-name myDockerVMVNET \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --service-endpoints Microsoft.ContainerRegistry
```

## Create and configure a container registry 

Create an ACR instance using the [az acr create][az-acr-create] command. The registry name must be unique within Azure, and contain 5-50 alphanumeric characters. In the following example, *myContainerRegistry717* is used. Update this to a unique value.

```azurecli
az acr create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myContainerRegistry717 --sku Basic
```

### Configure network access for container registry

By default, an Azure container registry accepts connections from clients on any network. To limit access to a selected network, you must change the default action. In preview, you can manage default network access rules for a container registry only through the Azure portal.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).
1. In the portal, navigate to your registry and select **Firewall and virtual networks**.
1. To deny access by default, choose to allow access from **Selected networks**. 
1. Select **Add existing virtual network**, and select the virtual network and subnet you created previously. Select **Add**. 
1. Select **Save**.

### Build and push a sample image to the registry

Run a sample [task](container-registry-tasks-multi-step.md) with [az acr run][az-acr-run] to build a `hello-world` container image and push it to your container registry:

```azurecli
az acr run --registry myContainerRegistry717 
 -f build-push-hello-world.yaml https://github.com/Azure-Samples/acr-tasks.git
```

To verify that the `hello-world` image is in a repository in your container registry, run the [az acr repository list][az-acr-repository-list] command:

```azurecli
az acr repository list --name myContainerRegistry717 --output tsv
```

Find the tag of the latest `hello-world` container image in your private registry using the following command:

```azurecli
az acr repository show-tags -n myContainerRegistry717 --repository hello-world --top 1 --detail --orderby time_desc --query "[].name" --output tsv
```

Make a note of the tag for later use when you try to pull the image.

### Configure ACR authentication

For this example, you configure registry access using [service principal authentication](container-registry-auth-service-principal.md). 

To create a service principal, see the [service-principal-create.sh](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cli-samples/blob/master/container-registry/service-principal-create/service-principal-create.sh) script on GitHub. For this example, assign the default `Reader` role to the service principal, to allow pulling images. 

The script stores the service principal ID in the *SP_APP_ID* variable, and the password in the *SP_PASSWD* variable. 

## Verify that the container registry is accessible from the VM

Make an SSH connection to your VM, and run the following command to login to your registry:

```bash
sudo docker login --username $SP_APP_ID --password $SP_PASSWD mycontainerregistry717.azurecr.io
```

You can pull the sample `hello-world` image in your registry. Substitute the tag of the latest image, which you obtained in an earlier step.

```bash
sudo docker pull mycontainerregistry717.azurecr.io/hello-world:tag
``` 

## Verify that container registry isn't accessible from the internet

Although you are able on the virtual machine to pull an image pulled from the private container registry, the registry can't be accessed from other networks. For example, you can't login to the registry over the internet from a different login host (such as your local computer) using the `docker login` command. 

```bash
sudo docker login --username $SP_APP_ID --password $SP_PASSWD mycontainerregistry717.azurecr.io
```

Output is similar to:

```Console
Error response from daemon: Get https://mycontainerregistry717.azurecr.io/v2/: unauthorized: authentication required
```
