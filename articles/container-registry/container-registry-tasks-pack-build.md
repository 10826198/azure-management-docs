# Build and push and image from an app using a Cloud Native Buildpack

The Azure CLI command `az acr pack build` uses the [`pack`](https://github.com/buildpack/pack) CLI tool, from [Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/), to build an app and push its image to an Azure container registry. This feature provides an option to quickly build a container image from your application source code in Node.js, Java, and other languages without having to define a Dockerfile.

You can use the Azure Cloud Shell or a local installation of the Azure CLI to run the examples in this article. If you'd like to use it locally, version 2.0.69 or later is required. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli-install].

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is currently in preview, and some [limitations apply](#preview-limitations). Previews are made available to you on the condition that you agree to the [supplemental terms of use][terms-of-use]. Some aspects of this feature may change prior to general availability (GA).

## Preview limitations


## Supported builders

* [Microsoft Oryx](https://github.com/microsoft/Oryx) - `mcr.microsoft.com/oryx/pack-builder:stable`
* Heroku Buildpacks - `heroku/buildpacks:18`

## Use the az acr pack build command

To build and push a container image using Cloud Native Buildpacks, run the [az acr pack build][az-acr-pack-build] command. Whereas the [az acr build][az-acr-build] command builds and pushes an image from a Dockerfile source and related code, with `az acr pack build` you specify an application source tree directly.

At a minimum you specify the following when you run `az acr pack build`:

* An Azure container registry where you run the command
* An image name and tag for the command output
* One of the [supported context locations](container-registry-tasks-overview.md#quick-task) for an ACR Task, such as a local directory, a GitHub repo, or a remote tarball
* Optionally the name of a container image for a [supported builder](#supported-builders). By default, the command uses the Microsoft Oryx builder to compile source code into a runnable container image. 

`az acr pack build` supports other features of ACR Tasks commands including [run variables](container-registry-tasks-reference-yaml.md#run-variables)and [task run logs](container-registry-tasks-overview.md#view-task-logs) that are streamed and saved for later inspection.

## Example: Build Node.js image with default builder

Te following example builds a container image from the Node.js app in the [Azure-Samples/nodejs-docs-hello-world](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/nodejs-docs-hello-world) repo, using the default Microsoft Oryx builder:

```azurecli
az acr pack build \
    --registry myregistry \
    --image {{.Run.Registry}}/node-app:{{.Run.Date}} \
    https://github.com/Azure-Samples/nodejs-docs-hello-world.git
```

This example builds the `node-app` image tagged with the run date of the command and pushes it to the *myregistry* container registry. Here, the target registry name is explicitly prepended to the image name. If not specified, the registry URL is automatically prepended to the image name.

Command output shows the progress of building and pushing the image. 



## Example: Build Java image with Heroku Buildpacks builder

The following example builds a container image from the Java app in the [buildpack/sample-java-app](https://github.com/buildpack/sample-java-app) repo, using the Heroku Buildpacks builder:

```azurecli
az acr pack build \
    --registry myregistry \
    --image java-app:{{.Run.ID}} \
    --pull --builder heroku/buildpacks:18 \
    https://github.com/buildpack/sample-java-app.git
```

This example builds the `java-app` image tagged with the run ID of the command and pushes it to the *myregistry* container registry.

The `--pull` parameter specifies that the command pulls the latest builder image, which is recommended when you use a non-default builder.
