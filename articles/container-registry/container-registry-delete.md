# Delete container images in Azure Container Registry

Each Azure container registry includes default [size limits](container-registry-skus.md#sku-feature-matrix), and requires periodic deletion of image data to maintain its size. Because you can delete several different resources like repositories, tags, and manifests, understanding exactly what is using space in your registry, and freeing that space, can at first seem difficult. This article starts by introducing the components of a Docker registry and its images, explains how to delete those components, and how deleting each affects the size of your registry.

## Components of a registry

Because Docker container images share layer data and include several components that can be deleted, managing registry size requires some knowledge of registry layout, and how container images are constructed.

### Registry

A container registry is a service that stores and distributes container images. For example, Docker Hub is a public Docker container registry, while Azure Container Registry provides private container registries in Azure.

### Repository

Within each registry are image *repositories*, collections of container images with the same name, but different tags. The name of an image is defined by the repository name, followed by a tag:

`repository:tag`

For example, these three images reside within the `acr-helloworld` repository, each with a different tag:

```
acr-helloworld:latest
acr-helloworld:v1
acr-helloworld:v2
```

## Components of an image

A container image consists of several components, many of which support deletion. Understanding how these components relate to one another can help you determine what to delete, and in which situations they should be deleted.

### Tag

An image's *tag* specifies its version. Images within a repository can also be "untagged." That is, you can delete a tag, while leaving the image data (its layers) within the registry.

You can push and pull an image by specifying its `repository:tag` in the push or pull operation.

### Layer

Images are made up of one or more *layers*, each of which corresponds to a line in the Dockerfile that defines the image. Images within a repository can share layers, reducing the storage required for those images sharing layers. Network traffic is also minimized, since layers already existing in the local filesystem do not need to be pulled again; only new or modified layers are pulled from the registry.

### Manifest

Within a container registry, an image *manifest* provides the identification and specifies the layers that make up an image within the registry.

### Digest

Manifests are identified by a unique SHA256 hash, or *digest*. A unique digest is generated by the registry each time you push an image to it. This is what allows you repeatedly push an identically tagged image to a registry. For example, you can repeatedly push `myimage:latest` to your registry without error because each image is identified by its unique digest.

This mechanism uniquely identifies the image even if its layer data is identical to that of another image in the registry, or multiple images with the same tag have been pushed. In addition, you can pull an image by specifying its digest in the pull operation. Some systems might be configured to pull by digest because it guarantees the image version being pulled, even if an identically tagged image is subsequently pushed to the registry.

## Delete image data

### Delete repository

### Delete by tag

### Delete by manifest
