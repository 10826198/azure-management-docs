<!-- VERSION 2
Template for the main monitoring article for Azure services. Keep the required sections and add/modify any content for any information specific to your service. 

This article should be in the How-To Guides section of your TOC with the name *monitor-[TODO-replace-with-service-name].md* and the TOC title "Monitor [TODO-replace-with-service-name]". Keep the headings in this order. 

Put accompanying reference information into an article in the Reference section of your TOC with the name *monitor-[service-name]-reference.md* and the TOC title "Monitoring data". -->

<!-- IMPORTANT STEP 1.  Do a search and replace of [TODO-replace-with-service-name] with the name of your service. That will make the template easier to read -->

# Monitor Azure Container Registry
<!-- REQUIRED. Please keep headings in this order -->
<!-- Most services can use this section unchanged. Add to it if there are any unique charges if your service has significant monitoring beyond Azure Monitor. -->

When you have critical applications and business processes relying on Azure resources, you want to monitor those resources for their availability, performance, and operation. This article describes the monitoring data generated by Azure Container Registry and how you can use the features of Azure Monitor to analyze and alert on this data.

<!-- Optional diagram showing monitoring for your service. If you need help creating one, contact robb@microsoft.com -->

## Monitor overview
<!-- REQUIRED. Please keep headings in this order -->
<!-- Most services can use this section unchanged. Edit it if there are any unique charges if your service has significant monitoring beyond Azure Monitor. -->

The **Overview** page in the Azure portal for each registry includes a brief view of recent resource usage and activity, such as storage used and pull requests. This high-level information is useful, but only a small amount of the monitoring data is shown there.

## What is Azure Monitor?
<!-- REQUIRED. Please keep headings in this order -->
<!-- Most services can use this section unchanged. Edit it if there are any unique charges if your service has significant monitoring beyond Azure Monitor. -->

Azure Container Registry creates monitoring data using [Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/overview), which is a full stack monitoring service in Azure that provides a complete set of features to monitor your Azure resources in addition to resources in other clouds and on-premises.

Start with the article [Monitoring Azure resources with Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/insights/monitor-azure-resource), which describes the following concepts:

- What is Azure Monitor?
- Costs associated with monitoring
- Monitoring data collected in Azure
- Configuring data collection
- Standard tools in Azure for analyzing and alerting on monitoring data

The following sections build on this article by describing the specific data gathered for Azure Container Registry and providing examples for configuring data collection and analyzing this data with Azure tools.



<!-- OPTIONAL SECTION.  Only include if your service has and insight associated with it. Examples of insights include
  - CosmosDB https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/cosmosdb-insights-overview
  - If you still aren't sure, contact azmondocs@microsoft.com.>

## Azure Monitor insights for Azure Container Registry

Some services in Azure have a special focused pre-built monitoring dashboard in the Azure portal that provides a starting point for monitoring your service. These special dashboards are called "insights". 

<!-- Give a quick outline of what your "insight page" provides and refer to another article that gives details -->




## Monitoring data 

<!-- REQUIRED. Please keep headings in this order -->
Azure Container Registry collects the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources that are described in [Monitoring data from Azure resources](/azure/azure-monitor/insights/monitor-azure-resource#monitoring-data-from-Azure-resources). 

See [Monitoring Azure Container Registry data reference](monitor-service-reference.md) for detailed information on the metrics and logs created by Azure Container Registry.

<!-- If your service has additional non-Azure Monitor monitoring data then outline and refer to that here. Also include that information in the data reference as appropriate. -->

## Collection and routing

<!-- REQUIRED. Please keep headings in this order -->

Platform metrics and the Activity log are collected and stored automatically, but can be routed to other locations by using a diagnostic setting.  

Resource Logs are not collected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting and route them to one or more locations.

<!-- Include any additional information on collecting logs.  The number of things that diagnostics settings control is expanding -->

See [Create diagnostic setting to collect platform logs and metrics in Azure](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings) for the detailed process for creating a diagnostic setting using the Azure portal, CLI, or PowerShell. When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. The categories for Azure Container Registry are listed in [Azure Container Registry monitoring data reference](monitor-service-reference.md#resource-logs).

> [!TIP]
> You can also create registry diagnostic settings by navigating to your registry in the portal. Then, select **Diagnostic settings** under **Monitoring**.

<!-- OPTIONAL: Add specific examples of configuration for this service. For example, CLI and PowerShell commands for creating diagnostic setting. Ideally, customers should set up a policy to automatically turn on collection for services. Azure monitor has Resource Manager template examples you can point to. See https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/samples/resource-manager-diagnostic-settings.  Contact azmondocs@microsoft.com if you have questions.   -->

The metrics and logs you can collect are discussed in the following sections.

## Analyzing metrics

<!-- REQUIRED. Please keep headings in this order 
If you don't support metrics, say so. Some services may be only onboarded to logs -->

You can analyze metrics for an Azure container registry with metrics from other Azure services using metrics explorer by opening **Metrics** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Getting started with Azure Metrics Explorer](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-getting-started) for details on using this tool. 

> [!TIP]
> You can also go to the metrics explorer by navigating to your registry in the portal. Then, select **Metrics (preview)** under **Monitoring**.

<!-- Point to the list of metrics available in your monitor-service-reference article. -->
For a list of the platform metrics collected for Azure Container Registry, see [Monitoring Azure Container Registry data reference metrics](monitor-service-reference.md#metrics)  

For reference, you can see a list of [all resource metrics supported in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-supported).

<!--  Optional: Call out additional information to help your customers. For example, you can include additional information here about how to use metrics explorer specifically for your service. Remember that the UI is subject to change quite often so you will need to maintain these screenshots yourself if you add them in. -->

## Analyzing logs

<!-- REQUIRED. Please keep headings in this order
If you don't support resource logs, say so. Some services may be only onboarded to metrics and the activity log. -->

Data in Azure Monitor Logs is stored in tables where each table has its own set of unique properties.  

All resource logs in Azure Monitor have the same fields followed by service-specific fields. The common schema is outlined in [Azure Monitor resource log schema](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-logs-schema#top-level-resource-logs-schema) The schema for Azure Container Registry resource logs is found in the [Azure Container Registry Data Reference](monitor-service-reference.md#schemas) 

The [Activity log](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/activity-log) is a platform log in Azure that provides insight into subscription-level events. You can view it independently or route it to Azure Monitor Logs, where you can do much more complex queries using Log Analytics.  

For a list of the types of resource logs collected for Azure Container Registry, see [Monitoring Azure Container Registry data reference](monitor-service-reference.md#resource-logs)  

For a list of the tables used by Azure Monitor Logs and queryable by Log Analytics, see [Monitoring Azure Container Reference data reference](monitor-service-reference.md#azure-monitor-logs-tables)  

<!--  Optional: Call out additional information to help your customers. For example, you can include additional information here about log usage or what logs are most important. Remember that the UI is subject to change quite often so you will need to maintain these screenshots yourself if you add them in. -->

### Sample Kusto queries

<!-- REQUIRED if you support logs. Please keep headings in this order -->
<!-- Add sample Log Analytics Kusto queries for your service. -->

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you select **Logs** from the **Azure Container Registry** menu, Log Analytics is opened with the query scope set to the current registry. This means that log queries will only include data from that resource. If you want to run a query that includes data from other registries or data from other Azure services, select **Logs** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Log query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](/azure/azure-monitor/log-query/scope/) for details.

<!-- REQUIRED: Include queries that are helpful for figuring out the health and state of your service. Ideally, use some of these queries in the alerts section. It's possible that some of your queries may be in the Log Analytics UI (sample or example queries). Check if so.  -->

Following are queries that you can use to help you monitor your registry resource. 

<!-- Put in a code section here. -->  

### Error events from the last hour

```Kusto
union Event, Syslog // Event table stores Windows event records, Syslog stores Linux records
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| where EventLevelName == "Error" // EventLevelName is used in the Event (Windows) records
	or SeverityLevel== "err" // SeverityLevel is used in Syslog (Linux) records
```

### 100 most recent registry events

```Kusto
ContainerRegistryRepositoryEvents
| union ContainerRegistryLoginEvents
| top 100 by TimeGenerated
| project TimeGenerated, LoginServer, OperationName, Identity, Repository, DurationMs, Region , ResultType
```

### Identity of user or object that deleted repository

```Kusto
ContainerRegistryRepositoryEvents
| where OperationName contains "Delete"
| project LoginServer, OperationName, Repository, Identity, CallerIpAddress
```

### Identity of user or object that deleted tag

```Kusto
ContainerRegistryRepositoryEvents
| where OperationName contains "Untag"
| project LoginServer, OperationName, Repository, Tag, Identity, CallerIpAddress
```

### Repository-level operation failures

```kusto
ContainerRegistryRepositoryEvents 
| where ResultDescription contains "40"
| project TimeGenerated, OperationName, Repository, Tag, ResultDescription
```

### Registry authentication failures

```kusto
ContainerRegistryLoginEvents 
| where ResultDescription != "200"
| project TimeGenerated, Identity, CallerIpAddress, ResultDescription
```


## Alerts

<!-- SUGGESTED: Include useful alerts on metrics, logs, log conditions or activity log. Ask your PMs if you don't know. 
This information is the BIGGEST request we get in Azure Monitor so do not avoid it long term. People don't know what to monitor for best results. Be prescriptive  
-->

Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when important conditions are found in your monitoring data. They allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them. You can set alerts on [metrics](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-metric-overview), [logs](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-unified-log), and the [activity log](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/activity-log-alerts). Different types of alerts have benefits and drawbacks.


<!-- only include next line if applications run on your service and work with App Insights. 

If you are creating or running an application which run on <*service*> [Azure Monitor Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/overview#application-insights) may offer additional types of alerts.
-->

The following table lists common and recommended alert rules for Azure Container Registry.

<!-- Fill in the table with metric and log alerts that would be valuable for your service. Change the format as necessary to make it more readable -->
| Alert type | Condition | Description  |
|:---|:---|:---|
| metric | Signal: Storage used<br/>Operator: Greater than<br/>Aggregation type: Average<br/>Threshold value: 5 GB|  Alerts if the registry storage used exceeds a specified value.|
