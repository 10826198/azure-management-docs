# Deploy Web App from Azure Container Registry

This is part three of a four-part tutorial. In the [previous step](./container-registry-tutorial-prepare-acr.md), a container image was created for a web application. In this tutorial, the image is deployed to Azure App Services in two regions. ACR Geo-replication will be configured in the same two regions, enabling local registry pull. If you have not created the container image, return to [Tutorial 1 â€“ Geo-replicate Azure Container Registry tutorial - Prepare Azure Container Registry](./container-registry-tutorial-prepare-acr.md).

Steps to complete include:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Deploy an image to Azure App Services
> * Convert the Container Registry to Premium
> * Geo-replicate an additional region
> * Deploy a secondary Azure App Service

In subsequent tutorials, you push a change to the registry, viewing the change in multiple regions, from multiple registry replicas.

## Deploy to Azure App Services

To aide in the automated update, we configure App Service from the ACR repository listing, which will configure the App Service with a Webhook, triggering automated deployments.

From the Azure portal, browse to Container registries.
Select the registry from the previous step.
Select **Repositories** to view the image pushed from the previous step.
You should see the **acr-helloworld**.

Click the image to see the list of image tags.

Right-click on the **latest** tag to view the deployment options:

![Tag Deployment Options](media/container-registry-tutorial-geo/tag-deployment-options.png)

Choose **Deploy to app service**

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| **Site Name**: | Represents the unique URL. `<acrname>-WestUS` |
| **Resource Group:** | `ACR-Helloworld-WestUS` |
| **App service plan/location:** | Select or create a plan in the same location of the previously created registry, keeping the deployment network-close to the registry. |
| **Image:** | `acr-helloworld:latest`

Click **Create** to provision the App

## View the configured App Service

Select App Services from the Azure portal

Find the App Service created: **ACR-Helloworld-WestUs**

In the top right of the overview tab, click the deployed URL to launch the newly created App Service

Once the docker image is deployed, the site reflects an image representing the Azure Region hosting the Container Registry.

## Deploy second Azure App Service

The acr-helloworld image displays the region where the image was retrieved.
To see the results of a geo-replicated registry, deploy a second App Service.

Select **Repositories** to view the `acr-helloworld` image.

Click the image to see the list of image tags.

Right-click on the **latest** tag to view the deployment options:

![Tag Deployment Options](media/container-registry-tutorial-geo/tag-deployment-options.png)

Choose **Deploy to app service**

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| **Site Name**: | Represents the unique URL. `<acrname>-EastUS` |
| **Resource Group:** | `ACR-Helloworld-EastUS` |
| **App service plan/location:** | Select or create a plan in the same location of the previously created registry, keeping the deployment network-close to the registry. |
| **Image:** | `acr-helloworld:latest`

Click **Create** to provision the App

![Configure App Service](media/container-registry-tutorial-geo/configure-app-service-eastus.png)

## View the configured App Service

Select App Services from the Azure portal

Find the App Service created: **ACR-Helloworld-EastUs**

In the top right of the overview tab, click the deployed URL to launch the newly created App Service

![App Service Url](media/container-registry-tutorial-geo/app-service-overview-url.png)

Once the docker image is deployed, the site reflects an image representing the Azure region hosting the Container Registry.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, an App Service was provisioned from the Container Registry to two regions. ACR was geo-replicated, enabling network-close image deployment.

The following steps were completed:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Deployed two Azure App Services, with webhooks for automated updates
> * ACR was geo-replicated between East US and West US Regions
> * The two regions viewed in the browser to confirm each App Service was served from a local registry replica

Advance to the next tutorial to deploy a change to both regions.
