# Azure container registry SKUs

Azure Container Registry is available in multiple tiers. ACR SKUs provide predictable pricing and options for how you wish to use a Private Registry. Choosing a higher SKU will provide more performance and scale. However, all SKUs provide the same programmatic capabilities, enabling a developer to get started with Basic and convert to Standard and Premium as their usage increases. 

## Basic
A cost-optimized entry point for developers learning about Azure Container Registry. Basic registries have the same programmatic capabilities as Standard and Premium (Azure Active Directory authentication integration, image deletion, and web hooks), however, there are size and usage constraints.

## Standard 
Offers the same capabilities as Basic, with increased storage limits and image throughput. Standard registries should satisfy the needs of most production scenarios.

## Premium
Offer higher limits on constraints, such as storage and concurrent operations enabling  high-volume scenarios. In addition to higher image throughput capacity, Premium adds features like [geo-replication](container-registry-geo-replication.md) for managing a single registry across multiple regions, maintaining a network-close registry to each deployment.

## Classic 
Classic provides minimal functionality, enabling an initial release of ACR. Classic registries required a storage account in the customers subscription, limiting the ability for ACR to provide higher level capabilities, such as increased performance throughput and geo-replication. 
> [!NOTE]
> Classic registries will be deprecated in the near future. Please see Basic, Standard or Premium registries for newly created registries. For existing Classic registries, please see Changing SKUs
>

| Feature | Basic | Standard | Premium |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Storage | 10 gib | 100 gib| 500 gib |
| ReadOps Per Minute | 1k | 300k | 10,000k | 
| WriteOps Per Minute | 100 | 500 | 2k | 
| Download Bandwidth MB/s | 30 | 60 | 100 |
| Upload Bandwidth MB/s | 10 | 20 | 50 |
| WebHooks | 2 | 10 | 100| 
| Geo-replication | N/A | N/A | [Supported *(Preview)*](container-registry-geo-replication.md) |

> [!Note]
> ReadOps, WriteOps & Bandwidth are minimum estimates. ACR will continue to strive to improve performance as usage requires.

### ReadOps
Docker pull translates to multiple read operations based on the number of layers, plus the manifest retrieval. 

Docker Reference: [Pulling An Image](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/#pulling-an-image)


### WriteOps
Docker push translates to multiple write operations, based on the number of layers that must be pushed. A docker push includes ReadOps to retrieve a manifest for an existing image. 

Docker Reference: [Pushing An Image](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/#pushing-an-image)

## Maintaining registry sizes
SKU storage constraints are intended to be aligned with the typical scenario. Basic for getting started, standard for the majority of production apps, while premium provides hyper-scale performance and [geo-replication](container-registry-geo-replication.md). 

Current usage of a registry can be found in the **overview**
![SKU Update](media/container-registry-skus/registry-overview-quotas.png)

Repository sizes can be maintained with the [az acr repository delete](/cli/azure/acr/repository?view=azure-cli-latest#az_acr_repository_delete) API.

# Why change from Classic to Basic/Standard/Premium
The Classic SKU was introduced to provide a private registry in Azure quickly. It is based on the OSS implementation. While a good product, we had the opportunity to more deeply integrate the registry into the capabilities of Azure. Some of the capabilities include:
* Integrating Azure Active Identity for individual authentication. See: [az acr login](/cli/azure/acr?view=azure-cli-latest#az_acr_login)
* Enable image and tag deletes: [az acr repository delete](/cli/azure/acr/repository?view=azure-cli-latest#az_acr_repository_delete)
* [Geo-replication](./container-registry-geo-replication)
* [WebHooks](./container-registry-webhook)

Most of all, the Classic registry depends on the storage account being provisioned in your subscription. Moving the management of storage to ACR enables:
* Default encrypted at rest of all images
* Offsite storage, assuring backup of all images
* Ability to move between SKUs, enabling higher throughput. ACR will meet the needs of your required throughput. This may be implemented by multiple storage accounts to provide concurrent pulls, or CDN as needs increase. The implementation for how ACR achieves the desired throughput is expressed as intent, without having to manage the implementation. 

Additional features will be coming, that provide a better view of how images are being used. 

* Telemetry of image usage over time
* Repository level permissions
* Base image caching and notifications

# Changing SKUs
Changing between SKUs can be completed through the Azure Portal or the az CLI.

## Changing SKUs with the Azure Portal
From **Overview** in the Azure Portal, choose **Update** to configure the desired SKU.
![SKU Update](media/container-registry-skus/update-registry-sku.png)


## Changing SKUs with the az cli
Change between SKUs using the [az acr update](/cli/azure/acr?view=azure-cli-latest#az_acr_update) api

Example: `ac acr update -n MyRegistry --sku premium`

## Changing from Classic
Changing from classic registries requires copying images from the associated storage account in the subscription. This process will take some time. While conversion, `docker pull` will continue to function, however `docker push` will be blocked until conversion is complete. 
Once completed, the subscription storage account is no longer used by ACR.
