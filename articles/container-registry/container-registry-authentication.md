# Authenticate with a private Docker container registry

There are several ways to authenticate with an Azure container registry, each of which applicable to one or more registry usage scenarios.

You can log in to a registry directly, which we'll call [individual login](#individual-login-with-azure-ad), and your applications and container orchestrators can perform unattended, or "headless," authentication by using an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) [service principal](#service-principal).

Azure Container Registry does not support anonymous login. For public images, you can use [Docker Hub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/).

## Individual login with Azure AD

Authenticate to your registry with the [az acr login](/cli/azure/acr?view=azure-cli-latest#az_acr_login) command in the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli):

```azurecli
az acr login --name <acrName>
```

When you log in with `az acr login`, the CLI creates an Azure AD [service principal](#service-principal) for you automatically, and uses it to seamlessly authenticate your session. Once you've logged in this way, your credentials are cached, and subsequent `docker` commands do not require a username or password.

## Service principal

You can assign a [service principal](../active-directory/develop/active-directory-application-objects.md) to your registry and use it for basic Docker authentication. Using a service principal is recommended for most authentication scenarios. This includes headless authentication from applications and container orchestrators, as well as users performing an [individual login](#individual-login-with-azure-ad) in the Azure CLI.

Service principals allow [role-based access](../active-directory/role-based-access-control-configure.md) to a registry. Available roles are:
  * **Reader**: pull only access
  * **Contributor**: pull and push
  * **Owner**: pull, push, and assign roles to other users

You can assign multiple service principals to a registry, which allows you to define access for different users or applications. Service principals enable headless connectivity to a registry in developer or DevOps scenarios like the following:

  * Container deployments from a registry to orchestration systems including Kubernetes, DC/OS, and Docker Swarm. You can also pull container registries to related Azure services such as [AKS](../aks/index.yml), [App Service](../app-service/index.yml), [Batch](../batch/index.md), [Service Fabric](/azure/service-fabric/), and others.

  * Continuous integration and deployment solutions (such as Visual Studio Team Services or Jenkins) that build container images and push them to a registry.

> [!TIP]
> You can regenerate the password of a service principal by running the `az ad sp reset-credentials` command.
>

You can also login directly with a service principal. Provide the app ID and password of the service principal to the `docker login` command:

```
docker login myregistry.azurecr.io -u xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx -p myPassword
```

Once logged in, Docker caches the credentials, so you don't need to remember the app ID.

## Admin account

Each container registry includes an admin user account, which is disabled by default. You can enable the admin user and manage its credentials in the [Azure portal](container-registry-get-started-portal.md#create-a-container-registry), or by using the Azure CLI.

The admin account is provided with two passwords, both of which can be regenerated. Two passwords allow you to maintain connection to the registry by using one password while you regenerate the other. If the admin account is enabled, you can pass the user name and either password to the `docker login` command for basic authentication to the registry. For example:

```
docker login myregistry.azurecr.io -u myAdminName -p myPassword1
```

To enable the admin user for an existing registry, you can use the `--admin-enabled` parameter of the [az acr update](/cli/azure/acr?view=azure-cli-latest#az_acr_update) command in the Azure CLI:

```azurecli
az acr update -n <acrName> --admin-enabled true
```

You can enable the admin user in the Azure portal by navigating your registry, selecting **Access keys** under **SETTINGS**, then **Enable** under **Admin user**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The admin account is designed for a single user to access the registry, mainly for testing purposes. We do not recommend sharing the admin account credentials with multiple users. All users authenticating with the admin account appear as a single user to the registry. Changing or disabling this account disables registry access for all users who use its credentials.
