# Quickstart: Deploy the Connected registry Arc extension (Preview)

In this quickstart, you learn how to deploy the Connected registry Arc extension using the CLI UX with secure-by-default settings to ensure robust security and operational integrity. 
 
The Connected registry is a pivotal tool for the edge customers for efficiently managing and accessing their containerized workloads, whether located on-premises or at remote sites. When Connected registry integrates with Azure arc, the service ensures a seamless and unified lifecycle management experience for Kubernetes-based containerized workloads. Deployment of the Connected registry arc extension on arc-enabled kubernetes clusters, simplifies the management and access of containerized workloads. 

## Prerequisites

* Create or use an existing Azure Container Registry (ACR) with [quickstart.][create-acr]

* Set up the firewall access and communication between the ACR and the Connected registry by enabling the [dedicated data endpoints.][dedicated data endpoints]

* Create or use an existing Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with the [tutorial.][tutorial-aks-cluster]

* Set up the connection between the Kubernetes cluster and Azure Arc by following the [quickstart.][quickstart-connect-cluster]

* Set up the [Azure CLI][Install Azure CLI] to connect to Azure and Kubernetes.

* Use the [k8s-extension][k8s-extension] command to manage Kubernetes extensions.

    ```azurecli
    az extension add --name k8s-extension
    ```
* Register the required [Azure resource providers][azure-resource-provider-requirements] in your subscription and use Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes:

    ```azurecli
    az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Kubernetes
    az provider register --namespace Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration
    az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ExtendedLocation
   
    ```
    An Azure resource provider is a set of REST operations that enable functionality for a specific Azure service. 

## Deploy the Connected registry Arc extension with secure-by-default settings

Once the prerequisites and necessary conditions and components are in place, follow the streamlined approach and securely deploy a Connected registry extension on an arc-enabled kubernetes cluster using secure-by-default settings. The secure-by-default settings define the following configuration with HTTPS, Read Only, Trust Distribution, Cert Manager service. Follow the steps for a successful deployment: 

1.	[Create the Connected registry.](#create-the-connected-registry-and-synchronize-with-acr)
1.	[Deploy the Connected registry Arc extension.](#deploy-the-connected-registry-arc-extension-on-the-arc-enabled-kubernetes-cluster)
1.	[Verify the Connected registry extension deployment.](#verify-the-connected-registry-extension-deployment) 
1.	[Pull an image from the Connected registry.](#pull-an-image-from-the-connected-registry)


### Create the Connected registry and synchronize with ACR

Creating the Connected registry to synchronize with ACR is the foundation step for deploying the Connected registry Arc extension. 

1. Create the Connected registry, which synchronizes with the ACR registry:

    To create a Connected registry `myconnectedregistry` that synchronizes with the ACR registry `myacrregistry` in the resource group `myresourcegroup` and the repository `hello-world`, you can run the [az acr connected-registry create][az-acr-connected-registry-create] command:
    
    ```azurecli
    az acr connected-registry create --registry myacrregistry \ 
    --name myconnectedregistry \
    --resource-group myresourcegroup \ 
    --repository "hello-world"
    ``` 

- The [az acr connected-registry create][az-acr-connected-registry-create] command creates the Connected registry with the specified repository. 
- The [az acr connected-registry create][az-acr-connected-registry-create] command overwrites actions if the sync scope map named `myconnectedregistry` exists and overwrites properties if the sync token named `myconnectedregistry` exists. 
- The [az acr connected-registry create][az-acr-connected-registry-create] command validates a dedicated data endpoint during the creation of the Connected registry and provides a command to enable the dedicated data endpoint on the ACR registry.

### Deploy the Connected registry arc extension on the Arc-enabled kubernetes cluster

Deploy the Connected registry arc extension to integrate the registry with your AKS cluster, for integration.

1. Generate the Connection String and Protected Settings JSON File

   For secure deployment of the Connected registry extension, generate the connection string, including a new password, transport protocol, and create the `protected-settings-extension.json` file required for the extension deployment with [az acr connected-registry get-settings][az-acr-connected-registry-get-settings] command:

    ```azurecli
    cat << EOF > protected-settings-extension.json
    {
      "connectionString": "$(az acr connected-registry get-settings \
      --name myconnectedregistry \
      --registry myacrregistry \
      --parent-protocol https \
      --generate-password 1 \
      --query ACR_REGISTRY_CONNECTION_STRING --output tsv --yes)"
    }
    EOF
    ```

- The [az acr connected-registry get-settings][az-acr-connected-registry-get-settings] command generates the connection string, including the creation of a new password and the specification of the transport protocol.
- It creates and injects the contents of the connection string into the `protected-settings-extension.json` file, a necessary step for the extension deployment.

2. Deploy the Connected registry extension

   Deploy the Connected registry extension with the specified configuration details using the [az k8s-extension create][az-k8s-extension-create] command:

    ```azurecli
    az k8s-extension create --cluster-name myarck8scluster \ 
    --cluster-type connectedClusters \
    --extension-type Microsoft.ContainerRegistry.ConnectedRegistry \
    --name myconnectedregistry \
    --resource-group myresourcegroup \ 
    --config service.clusterIP=192.100.100.1 \ 
    --config-protected-file protected-settings-extension.json  
    ```

- The [az k8s-extension create][az-k8s-extension-create] command deploys the Connected registry extension on the Kubernetes cluster with the provided configuration parameters and protected settings file. 
- It ensures secure trust distribution between the Connected registry and all client nodes within the cluster and installs the cert-manager service for Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption.
- The `service.clusterIP` parameter specifies the IP address of the Connected registry service within the cluster. The `service.clusterIP` must be set within the range of valid service IPs for the Kubernetes (k8s) cluster. It is crucial to ensure that the IP address specified for `service.clusterIP` falls within the designated service IP range defined during the cluster's initial configuration. This range is typically found in the cluster's networking settings. If the `service.clusterIP` is not within this range, it must be updated to an IP address that is both within the valid range and not currently in use by another service.


### Verify the Connected registry extension deployment

To verify the deployment of the Connected registry extension on the Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster, follow the steps:

1. Verify the deployment status

    Run the [az k8s-extension show][az-k8s-extension-show] command to check the deployment status of the Connected registry extension:

    ```azurecli
    az k8s-extension show --name myconnectedregistry \ 
    --cluster-name myarck8scluster \
    --resource-group myresourcegroup \
    --cluster-type connectedClusters
    ```
    **Example Output**

    ```output
      {
      "aksAssignedIdentity": null,
      "autoUpgradeMinorVersion": true,
      "configurationProtectedSettings": {
        "connectionString": ""
      },
      "configurationSettings": {
        "pvc.storageClassName": "standard",
        "pvc.storageRequest": "250Gi",

      },
      "type": "Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration/extensions",
      "version": null
    }
    ```    

2. Verify the Connected registry status and state

    For each Connected registry, you can view the status and state of the Connected registry using the [az acr connected-registry list][az-acr-connected-registry-list] command:
    
    ```azurecli
        az acr connected-registry list --registry myacrregistry \
        --output table
    ```

**Example Output**

```console
    | NAME | MODE | CONNECTION STATE | PARENT | LOGIN SERVER | LAST SYNC(UTC) |
    |------|------|------------------|--------|--------------|----------------|
    | myconnectedregistry | ReadWrite | online | myacrregistry | myacrregistry.azurecr.io | 2024-05-09 12:00:00 |
    | myreadonlyacr | ReadOnly | offline | myacrregistry | myacrregistry.azurecr.io | 2024-05-09 12:00:00 |
```

3. Verify the specific Connected registry details

    For details on a specific Connected registry, use [az acr connected-registry show][az-acr-connected-registry-show] command:

    ```azurecli
    az acr connected-registry show --registry myacrregistry \
    --name myreadonlyacr \ 
    --output table
    ```

    **Example Output**
    ```console
   | NAME                | MODE      | CONNECTION STATE | PARENT        | LOGIN SERVER             | LAST SYNC(UTC)      | SYNC SCHEDULE | SYNC WINDOW       |
   | ------------------- | --------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
   | myconnectedregistry | ReadWrite | online           | myacrregistry | myacrregistry.azurecr.io | 2024-05-09 12:00:00 | 0 0 * * *     | 00:00:00-23:59:59 |
    ```

- The [az k8s-extension show][az-k8s-extension-show] command verifies the state of the extension deployment.
- The command also provides details on the Connected registry's connection status, last sync, sync window, sync schedule, and more.

### Pull an image from the Connected registry 

To authenticate and pull an image from the locally deployed Connected registry within the cluster from a cluster client node, follow the steps:

1. Authenticate and pull the desired image from the Connected registry using the [ crictl pull] command with the IP address `10.10.10.10` of the Connected registry, and the Image name `hello-world` with tag `latest`:

    ```azurecli
    crictl pull --creds mytoken:password1 10.10.10.10/hello-world:latest
    ```

    For example, to pull the `hello-world:latest` image, from the Connected registry with the IP address `10.10.10.10` run:

    ```azurecli
    crictl pull --creds mytoken:password1 10.10.10.10/hello-world:latest
    ```

- The `crictl pull` command pulls an image from the Connected registry by specifying the desired repository. Learn to create a client token [here.](container-registry-repository-scoped-permissions.md#create-token---cli)

## Clean up resources

By deleting the deployed Connected registry extension, you remove the corresponding Connected registry pods and configuration settings.  

1. Delete the Connected registry extension

    Run the [az k8s-extension delete][az-k8s-extension-delete] command to delete the Connected registry extension: 

    ```azurecli
    az k8s-extension delete --name myconnectedregistry 
    --cluster-name myarcakscluster \ 
    --resource-group myresourcegroup \ 
    --cluster-type connectedClusters
    ```   
   
By deleting the deployed Connected registry extension, you remove the Connected registry cloud instance and its configuration details. 

2. Delete the Connected registry

    Run the [az acr connected-registry delete][az-acr-connected-registry-delete] command to delete the Connected registry: 

    ```azurecli
    az acr connected-registry delete --name myarcakscluster \ 
    --resource-group myresourcegroup 
    ```
