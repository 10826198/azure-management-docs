# Discover and deploy workload templates from Microsoft Copilot in Azure

Microsoft Copilot in Azure (preview) can help you find workload deployment templates that suit your needs by quickly searching through extensive repositories to identify the best matches. It provides recommendations based on the latest best practices and industry standards, helping you effectively deploy your workloads.

For example, to create an ecommerce website using Django framework, you can say "I want to create an ecommerce website using Django framework." Copilot in Azure shows a recommendation with a link to the GitHub repository that you can use.
