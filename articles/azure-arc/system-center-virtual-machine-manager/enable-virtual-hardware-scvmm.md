# Enable virtual hardware and VM CRUD capabilities in an SCVMM machine with Arc agent installed

In this article, you learn how to enable virtual hardware management and VM CRUD operational ability on an SCVMM VM that has Arc agents installed via the Arc-enabled Servers route.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> This article is applicable only if you've installed Arc agents directly in SCVMM machines before onboarding to Azure Arc-enabled SCVMM by deploying Arc resource bridge. 

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription and resource group where you have *Arc ScVmm VM Administrator* role. 
- Your SCVMM management server instance must be [onboarded](quickstart-connect-system-center-virtual-machine-manager-to-arc.md) to Azure Arc.

## Enable virtual hardware management and self-service access to SCVMM VMs with Arc agent installed

1. From your browser, go to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Navigate to the Virtual machines inventory page of your SCVMM management servers. The virtual machines that have Arc agent installed via the Arc-enabled Servers route will have **Link to SCVMM management server** status under virtual hardware management.

1. Select **Link to SCVMM management server** to view the pane with the list of all the machines under SCVMM management server with Arc agent installed but not linked to the SCVMM management server in Azure Arc.

1. Choose all the machines that need to be enabled in Azure, and select **Link** to link the machines to SCVMM management server.

1. After you link to SCVMM management server, the virtual hardware status will reflect as **Enabled** for all the VMs, and you can perform virtual hardware operations. 

### Known issue
 
During the first scan of the SCVMM management server inventory after onboarding to Azure Arc-enabled SCVMM, Arc-enabled Servers machines will be discovered under SCVMM inventory. If the Arc-enabled Server machines aren't discovered and you try to perform the **Enable in Azure** operation, you'll encounter the following error:<br>

*A machine '/subscriptions/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX/resourceGroups/rg-contoso/providers/Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines/testVM1' already exists with the specified virtual machine MoRefId: 'vm-4441'. The existing machine resource can be extended with private cloud capabilities by creating the VirtualMachineInstance resource under it.*

When you encounter this error message, try performing the **Link to SCVMM management server** operation again after a few minutes (5-10 minutes). Alternatively, you can use the following Azure CLI command to link an existing Arc-enabled Server machine to SCVMM management server:<br>


```azurecli-interactive
az scvmm vm create --subscription <subscription-id> --location <Azure region of the machine> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --custom-location /providers/microsoft.extendedlocation/customlocations/<custom-location-name> --name <machine-name> --inventory-item /subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.ScVmm/<vmmserver-name>/contoso-vm/InventoryItems/<machine-name>
```
