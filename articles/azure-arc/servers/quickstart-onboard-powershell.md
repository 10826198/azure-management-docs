# Connect hybrid machines to Azure at scale

You can enable Azure Arc for servers (preview) for multiple Windows or Linux machines in your environment by performing a set of steps manually. Or you can use an automated method by running a template script that we provide. This script automates the download and installation of the Connected Machine agent for both operating systems. To connect the machines to Azure Arc for servers, you can use an Azure Active Directory [service principal](../../active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals.md) instead of using your privileged identity to [interactively connect the machine](quickstart-onboard-portal.md). A service principal is a special limited management identity that is granted only the minimum permission necessary to connect machines to Azure using the `azcmagent` command. This is safer than using a higher privileged account like a Tenant Administrator, and follows our access control security best practices. The service principal is used only during onboarding, it is not used for any other purpose.  

The installation methods to install and configure the Connected Machine agent requires that you have administrator permissions on the machines. On Linux, by using the root account and on Windows, you are a member of the Local Administrators group.

Before you get started, be sure to review the [prerequisites](overview.md#prerequisites) and verify that your subscription and resources meet the requirements.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Create a Service Principal for onboarding at scale

You can use [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps) to create a service principal with the [New-AzADServicePrincipal](/powershell/module/Az.Resources/New-AzADServicePrincipal) cmdlet. Or you can follow the steps listed under [Create a Service Principal using the Azure portal](../../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md) to complete this task.

> [!NOTE]
> When you create a service principal, your account must be an Owner or User Access Administrator in the subscription that you want to use for onboarding. If you don't have sufficient permissions to create role assignments, the service principal might be created, but it won't be able to onboard machines.
>

The **Azure Connected Machine Onboarding** role contains only the permissions required to onboard a machine. You can assign the service principal permission to allow its scope to include a resource group or a subscription. 

To create the service principal using PowerShell, perform the following.

1. Run the following command. You must store the output of the [`New-AzADServicePrincipal`](/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azadserviceprincipal) cmdlet in a variable, or you will not be able to retrieve the password needed in a later step.

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    $sp = New-AzADServicePrincipal -DisplayName "Arc-for-servers" -Role "Azure Connected Machine Onboarding"
    $sp
    ```

    ```output
    Secret                : System.Security.SecureString
    ServicePrincipalNames : {ad9bcd79-be9c-45ab-abd8-80ca1654a7d1, https://Arc-for-servers}
    ApplicationId         : ad9bcd79-be9c-45ab-abd8-80ca1654a7d1
    ObjectType            : ServicePrincipal
    DisplayName           : Hybrid-RP
    Id                    : 5be92c87-01c4-42f5-bade-c1c10af87758
    Type                  :
    ```

2. To retrieve the password stored in the `$sp` variable, run the following command:

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    $credential = New-Object pscredential -ArgumentList "temp", $sp.Secret
    $credential.GetNetworkCredential().password
    ```

3. In the output, find the password value under the field **password** and copy it. Also find the value under the field **ApplicationId** and copy it also. Save them for later in a secure place. If you If you forget or lose your service principal password, you can reset it using the [`New-AzADSpCredential`](/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/new-azurermadspcredential) cmdlet.

The values from the following properties are used with parameters passed to the `azcmagent`:

* The value from the **ApplicationId** property is used for the `--service-principal-id` parameter value
* The value from the **password** property is used for the  `--service-principal-secret` parameter used to connect the agent.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to use the service principal **ApplicationId** property, not the **Id** property.

## Install the agent and connect to Azure

Installing the Connected Machine agent can be performed by following the steps outlined in the [Connect hybrid machines to Azure from the Azure portal](quickstart-onboard-portal.md) article. While you can install the Windows or Linux agent manually, using a service principal with the script template we provide allows you to automate the entire process. 



On Windows, open PowerShell as administrator on a target node and run:

```powershell
& "$env:ProgramFiles\AzureConnectedMachineAgent\azcmagent.exe" connect `
  --service-principal-id "{your-azadsp-appid}" `
  --service-principal-secret "{your-azadsp-password}" `
  --resource-group "{your-resource-group-name}" `
  --tenant-id "{your-tenant-id}" `
  --location "{desired-location}" `
  --subscription-id "{your-subscription-id}"
```

On Linux, open a shell and run

<!-- Same command for linux?-->
```bash
azcmagent connect \
  --service-principal-id "{your-spn-appid}" \
  --service-principal-secret "{your-spn-password}" \
  --resource-group "{your-resource-group-name}" \
  --tenant-id "{your-tenant-id}" \
  --location "{location-of-your-resource-group}" \
  --subscription-id "{your-subscription-id}"
```

Parameters:

* `tenant-id` : The Tenant GUID. You can find it in Azure portal by selecting **Azure Active directory** -> **properties** -> **Directory ID**.
* `subscription-id` : The GUID of the subscription, in Azure, where you want to connect your machine.
* `resource-group` : The resource group where you want your machine connected.
* `location` : See [Azure regions and locations](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/regions/). This location can be the same, or different, as the resource group's location. For public preview, the service is supported in **WestUS2**, **SouthEast Asia**, and **West Europe**.
* `resource-name` :  (*Optional*) Used for the Azure resource representation of your on-premises machine. If you do not specify this value, the machine hostname will be used.

You can learn more about the `azcmagent' command line tool by reviewing the [Azcmagent Reference](azcmagent-reference.md).

After you install the agent and configure it to connect to Azure Arc for servers (preview), go to the Azure portal to verify that the server has been successfully connected. View your machines in the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/hybridmachineportal).
