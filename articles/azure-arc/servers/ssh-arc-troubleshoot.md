# Troubleshoot SSH access to Azure Arc-enabled servers

This article provides information on troubleshooting and resolving issues that may occur while attempting to connect to Azure Arc-enabled servers via SSH.
For general information, see [SSH access to Arc-enabled servers overview](./ssh-arc-overview.md).

## Client-side issues

These issues are due to errors that occur on the machine that the user is connecting from.

### Incorrect Azure subscription

This problem occurs when the active subscription for Azure CLI isn't the same as the server that is being connected to. Possible errors:

- `Unable to determine the target machine type as Azure VM or Arc Server`
- `Unable to determine that the target machine is an Arc Server`
- `Unable to determine that the target machine is an Azure VM`
- `The resource \<name\> in the resource group \<resource group\> was not found`

Resolution:

#### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

- Run ```az account set -s <AzureSubscriptionId>``` where `AzureSubscriptionId` corresponds to the subscription that contains the target resource.

#### [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

- Run ```Set-AzContext -Subscription <AzureSubscriptionId>``` where `AzureSubscriptionId` corresponds to the subscription that contains the target resource.

### Unable to locate client binaries

This issue occurs when the client side SSH binaries required to connect aren't found. Possible errors:

- `Failed to create ssh key file with error: \<ERROR\>.`
- `Failed to run ssh command with error: \<ERROR\>.`
- `Failed to get certificate info with error: \<ERROR\>.`
- `Failed to create ssh key file with error: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified.`
- `Failed to create ssh key file with error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'ssh-keygen'.`

Resolution:

- Provide the path to the folder that contains the SSH client executables by using the ```--ssh-client-folder``` parameter.

### Azure PowerShell module version mis-match 
This issue occurs when the installed Azure PowerShell sub-module, Az.Ssh.ArcProxy, is not supported by the installed version of Az.Ssh. Error:
- `This version of Az.Ssh only supports version 1.x.x of the Az.Ssh.ArcProxy PowerShell Module. The Az.Ssh.ArcProxy module {ModulePath} version is {ModuleVersion}, and it is not supported by this version of the Az.Ssh module. Check that this version of Az.Ssh is the latest available.`

Resolution:

- Update the Az.Ssh and Az.Ssh.ArcProxy modules

### Az.Ssh.ArcProsy not installed
This issue occurs when the proxy module is not found on the client machine.

Resolution:

- Install the module from the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Az.Ssh.ArcProxy): `Install-Module -Name Az.Ssh.ArcProxy`

## Server-side issues

### SSH traffic not allowed on the server
This issue occurs when SSHD isn't running on the server, or SSH traffic isn't allowed on the server. Error:

- `{"level":"fatal","msg":"sshproxy: error copying information from the connection: read tcp 192.168.1.180:60887-\u003e40.122.115.96:443: wsarecv: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.","time":"2022-02-24T13:50:40-05:00"}`
- `SSH connection is not enabled in the target port {Port}. `

Resolution:
 - Ensure that the SSHD service is running on the Arc-enabled server.
 - Ensure that the functionality is enabled on your Arc-enabled server on port 22 (or other non-default port) 

#### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```az rest --method put --uri https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscription>/resourceGroups/<resourcegroup>/providers/Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines/<arc enabled server name>/providers/Microsoft.HybridConnectivity/endpoints/default/serviceconfigurations/SSH?api-version=2023-03-15 --body '{\"properties\": {\"serviceName\": \"SSH\", \"port\": \"22\"}}'```

#### [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```Invoke-AzRestMethod -Method put -Path https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscription>/resourceGroups/<resourcegroup>/providers/Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines/<arc enabled server name>/providers/Microsoft.HybridConnectivity/endpoints/default/serviceconfigurations/SSH?api-version=2023-03-15 -Payload '{\"properties\": {\"serviceName\": \"SSH\", \"port\": \"22\"}}'```

## Azure permissions issues

### Incorrect role assignments
This issue occurs when the current user doesn't have the proper role assignment on the target resource, specifically a lack of `read` permissions. Possible errors:

- `Unable to determine the target machine type as Azure VM or Arc Server`
- `Unable to determine that the target machine is an Arc Server`
- `Unable to determine that the target machine is an Azure VM`
- `Permission denied (publickey).`
- `Request for Azure Relay Information Failed: (AuthorizationFailed) The client '\<user name\>' with object id '\<ID\>' does not have authorization to perform action 'Microsoft.HybridConnectivity/endpoints/listCredentials/action' over scope '/subscriptions/\<Subscription ID\>/resourceGroups/\<Resource Group\>/providers/Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines/\<Machine Name\>/providers/Microsoft.HybridConnectivity/endpoints/default' or the scope is invalid. If access was recently granted, please refresh your credentials.`
- `Client is not authorized to create a Default connectivity endpoint for {Name} in the Resource Group {ResourceGroupName}. This is a one-time operation that must be performed by an account with Owner or Contributor role to allow connections to target resource`

Resolution:
- Ensure that you have Contributor or Owner permissions on the resource you're connecting to.
- If using Azure AD login, ensure you have the Virtual Machine User Login or the Virtual Machine Administrator Login roles

### HybridConnectivity RP not registered

This issue occurs when the HybridConnectivity resource provider isn't registered for the subscription. Error:

- Request for Azure Relay Information Failed: (NoRegisteredProviderFound) Code: NoRegisteredProviderFound

Resolution:

- Run ```az provider register -n Microsoft.HybridConnectivity```
- Confirm success by running ```az provider show -n Microsoft.HybridConnectivity```, verify that `registrationState` is set to `Registered`
- Restart the hybrid agent on the Arc-enabled server


 ## Disable SSH to Arc-enabled servers
 
 This functionality can be disabled by completing the following actions:
  - Remove the SSH port and functionality from the Arc-enabled server: ```az rest --method delete --uri https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscription>/resourceGroups/<resourcegroup>/providers/Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines/<arc enabled server name>/providers/Microsoft.HybridConnectivity/endpoints/default/serviceconfigurations/SSH?api-version=2023-03-15 --body '{\"properties\": {\"serviceName\": \"SSH\", \"port\": \"22\"}}'```
  - Delete the default connectivity endpoint: ```az rest --method delete --uri https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscription>/resourceGroups/<resourcegroup>/providers/Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines/<arc enabled server name>/providers/Microsoft.HybridConnectivity/endpoints/default?api-version=2023-03-15```
