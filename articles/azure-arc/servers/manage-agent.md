# Managing and maintaining the Connected Machine agent

After initial deployment of the Azure Arc for servers (preview) Connected Machine agent for Windows or Linux, you may need to reconfigure the agent, upgrade it, or remove it from the computer if it has reached the retirement stage in its lifecycle. You can easily manage these routine maintenance tasks manually or through automation, which reduces both operational error and expenses.

## Upgrading agent

The Azure Connected Machine agent for Windows and Linux can be upgraded to the latest release manually or automatically depending on your requirements. The following table describes the methods supported to perform the agent upgrade.

| Operating system | Upgrade method |
|------------------|----------------|
| Windows | Manually<br> Windows Update |
| Ubuntu | [Apt](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/apt.html) |
| SUSE Linux Enterprise Server | [zypper](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Zypper_usage_11.3) |
| Red Hat Enterprise, Amazon, CentOS Linux | [yum](https://wiki.centos.org/PackageManagement/Yum) | 

### Windows agent

To update the agent on a Windows machine to the latest version, the agent is available from Microsoft Update and can be deployed using your existing software update management process. It can also be run manually from the Command Prompt, from a script or other automation solution, or from the UI wizard by executing `AzureConnectedMachine.msi`. 

> [!NOTE]
> * To upgrade the agent, you must have *Administrator* permissions.
> * To upgrade manually, you must first download and copy the Installer package to a folder on the target server, or from a shared network folder. 

#### To upgrade using the Setup Wizard

1. Sign on to the computer with an account that has administrative rights.

2. Execute **AzureConnectedMachineAgent.msi** to start the Setup Wizard.

3. The Setup Wizard discovers if a previous version exists, and then it automatically performs an upgrade of the agent. When the upgrade completes, the Setup Wizard automatically closes.

#### To upgrade from the command line

1. Sign on to the computer with an account that has administrative rights.

2. To upgrade the agent silently and create a setup log file in the `C:\Support\Logs` folder, run the following command.

    ```dos
    msiexec.exe /i AzureConnectedMachineAgent.msi /qn /l*v "C:\Support\Logs\Azcmagentupgradesetup.log"
    ```

### Linux agent

## Remove the agent
