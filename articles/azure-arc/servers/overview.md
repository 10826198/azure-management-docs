# What is Azure Arc for servers (preview)

Azure Arc for servers (preview) allows you to manage your Windows and Linux machines hosted outside of Azure on your corporate network or other cloud provider, similarly to how you manage native Azure virtual machines. When a hybrid machine is connected to Azure, it becomes a **Connected Machine** and is treated as a resource in Azure. Each **Connected Machine** has a Resource ID, is managed as part of a resource group inside a subscription, and benefits from standard Azure constructs such as Azure Policy and applying tags.

To deliver this experience with your hybrid machines hosted outside of Azure, the Azure Connected Machine agent needs to be installed on each machine that you plan on connecting to Azure. This agent does not deliver any other functionality, and it doesn't replace the Azure [Log Analytics agent](../../azure-monitor/platform/log-analytics-agent.md). The Log Analytics agent for Windows and Linux is required when you want to proactively monitor the OS and workloads running on the machine, manage it using Automation runbooks or solutions like Update Management, or use other Azure services like [Azure Security Center](../../security-center/security-center-intro.md).

>[!NOTE]
>The Public Preview release is designed for evaluation purposes and we recommend not managing critical production resources.

## Supported scenarios

Azure Arc for servers (preview) supports the following scenarios with connected machines:

- Assign [Azure Policy guest configurations](../../governance/policy/concepts/guest-configuration.md) using the same experience as policy assignment for Azure virtual machines.
- Log data collected by the Log Analytics agent and stored in the Log Analytics workspace the machine is registered with now contains properties specific to the machine, such as Resource ID, which can be used to support [resource-context](../../azure-monitor/platform/design-logs-deployment.md#access-mode) log access.

## Prerequisites

### Supported operating systems

The following versions of the Windows and Linux operating system are officially supported for the Azure Connected Machine agent: 

- Windows Server 2012 R2 and higher
- Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04

## Azure subscription and service limits

Before configuring your machines with Azure Arc for servers (preview), you should review the Azure Resource Manager [subscription limits](../../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits.md#subscription-limits---azure-resource-manager) and [resource group limits](../../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits.md#resource-group-limits) to plan for the number of machines to be connected.

## Networking Configuration

The agent for Linux and Windows communicates outbound to Azure Arc over TCP port 443, and if the machine connects through a firewall or proxy server to communicate over the Internet, review requirements below to understand the network configuration required. If your IT security policies do not allow computers on the network to connect to the Internet, you can direct traffic through an HTTPS proxy.

If outbound connectivity is blocked by your firewall or proxy, make sure that the following URLs are not blocked. If you allow the IP ranges or domain names required for the agent to communicate with the service, you must allow TCP port 443 access to the following Service Tags and URLs.

Service Tags:

- AzureActiveDirectory
- AzureTrafficManager

For a list of IP addresses for each service tag/region, see the JSON file - [Azure IP Ranges and Service Tags â€“ Public Cloud](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56519). Microsoft publishes weekly updates containing each Azure Service and the IP ranges it uses. See [Service tags](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/security-overview#service-tags), for more details.

The following URLs are required in addition to the Service Tag IP address range information because the majority of services do not currently have a Service Tag registration. As such, the IP addresses are subject to change. If IP address ranges are required for your firewall configuration, then the **AzureCloud** Service Tag should be used to allow access to all Azure services. Do not disable security monitoring or inspection of these URLs, allow them as you would other internet traffic.

| Agent resource | Description |

|management.azure.com|Azure Resource Manager|
|login.windows.net|Azure Active Directory|
|dc.services.visualstudio.com|Application Insights|

## Installing the agent 

Connecting machines in your hybrid environment directly with Azure can be accomplished using different methods depending on your requirements. The following table highlights each method to determine which works best for your organization.

| Method | Description | 
|--------|-------------|
| Interactively | Manually install the agent on a single or small number of machines following the [Portal Quickstart](quickstart-onboard-portal.md).<br> From the Azure portal you can generate a script and execute it on the machine to automate the install and configuration steps.|
| At scale | Install and configure the agent for multiple machines following the [PowerShell Quickstart](quickstart-onboard-powershell.md).<br> This method creates a service principal to connect machines non-interactively.|
