# Connect machines at scale with a Configuration Manager custom task sequence

Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager facilitates comprehensive management of servers supporting the secure and scalable deployment of applications, software updates, and operating systems. Configuration Manager offers the custom task sequence as a flexible paradigm for application deployment.
