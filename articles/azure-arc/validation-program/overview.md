# Overview of Azure Arc-enabled service validation

Microsoft recommends running Azure Arc-enabled services on validated platforms. This article points you to content to explain how various Azure Arc-enabled components are validated. 

Currently, validated solutions are available from partners for Kubernetes and data services.

## Kubernetes

Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes works with any Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) certified Kubernetes clusters. The Azure Arc team has worked with key industry Kubernetes offering providers to validate Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes with their [Kubernetes distributions](../kubernetes/validation-program.md). Future major and minor versions of Kubernetes distributions released by these providers will be validated for compatibility with Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes.

## Data services

We have also partnered with original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners and storage providers to validate [Azure Arc-enabled data services](../data/validation-program) solutions.

## Next steps

* [Validated Kubernetes distributions](../kubernetes/validation-program.md)

* [Validated Kubernetes distributions for data services](../data/validation-program.md)
