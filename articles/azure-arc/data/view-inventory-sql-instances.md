# Scenario: View inventory of your instances in the Azure portal

After you have uploaded your [metrics, logs](upload-metrics-and-logs-to-azure-monitor.md), or [usage](view-billing-data-in-azure.md), you can view your instance as an Azure resource from the Azure portal. To do so navigate to the special URL [https://aka.ms/arcdata](https://aka.ms/arcdata) and follow the screen shots below

1. Go to All services
1. Hover over Azure SQL
1. Add it to your favorites
1. Click on Azure SQL from the left nav
1. View your instances in the same view as your other Azure SQL resources (use filters to get a granular view)
