# Scenario: Use Azure Data Studio to manage your Postgres instance


This scenario will show you:
- how to manage your Postgres instances with dashboard views like Overview, Connection Strings, Properties, Resource Health...
- how to work with your data and schema

## Get started with Azure Data Studio

For starting, you need to install Azure Data Studio as explained in [this scenario](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-data-services-on-Azure-Arc/blob/jul-2020/scenarios/001-install-client-tools.md#step-8-install-azure-data-studio-and-arc-extension-and-log-into-azure).

Once installed, start Azure Data Studio and reach its welcome page:

## Connect to the Azure Arc Data Controller

In Azure Data Studio, expand the node [Azure Arc Controllers] and click the [Connect Controller] button:
![Screenshot of Azure Data Controllers node expanded.](/assets/ADS_Jul2020_ConnectDataController.jpg)


Enter the connection information to your Azure Data Controller:
- **Controller URL:**
    This is the URL to connect to your controller in Kubernetes. It has to be entered in the form of https://IP_address_of_the_controller:Kubernetes_port.
    For example:
    ```terminal
    https://12.345.67.890:30080
    ```
- **Username:**
    Name of the user you use to connect to the Controller. That is the name you typically use when you run '__azdata login__'. It is not the name of the Postgres user you use to connect to the Postgres database engine typically from psql.
- **Password:**
    The password of the user account you use to connect to the Controller

and click the [Connect] button.

Your Arc Data Controller node is now showing up. Expand it and it shows the list of Postgres instances that it manages.

## Manage your Postgres instances

Right click on the Postgres instance you want to manage and click [Manage]
![Screenshot of Azure Data Controllers [Manage] contextual menu.](/assets/ADS_Jul2020_Controller_Postgres_Manage.jpg)

This opens the Postgres Dashboard view:
![Screenshot of Azure Data Controllers\Postgres dashboard - List.](/assets/ADS_Jul2020_Controller_Postgres_Dashboard_List.jpg)

That features several dashboards listed on the left side of that pane:
- **Overview:** 
    Displays summary information about your instance like name, Azure subscription ID, configuration, version of the database engine, endpoints for Grafana and Kibana...
    ![Screenshot of Azure Data Controllers\Postgres dashboard - Overview.](/assets/ADS_Jul2020_Controller_Postgres_Dashboard_Overview.jpg)
- **Connection Strings:** 
    Displays various connection strings you may need to connect to your Postgres instance like psql, Node.js, PHP, Ruby...
    ![Screenshot of Azure Data Controllers\Postgres dashboard - Connection strings.](/assets/ADS_Jul2020_Controller_Postgres_Dashboard_ConnectionStrings.jpg)
- **Properties:**
    Displays various properties like Postgres admin user name, associated resources group for the shadow resource...
    ![Screenshot of Azure Data Controllers\Postgres dashboard - Properties.](/assets/ADS_Jul2020_Controller_Postgres_Dashboard_Properties.jpg)
- **Resource health:** 
    Health of the pods hosting your instance: overview and details for various states like running, pending, failed...
    ![Screenshot of Azure Data Controllers\Postgres dashboard - Resource Health.](/assets/ADS_Jul2020_Controller_Postgres_Dashboard_ResourceHealth.jpg)
- **Diagnose and solve problems:** 
    Is the landing page where you will find various resources that will help you troubleshoot your instance as we expand the troubleshooting notebooks
- **New support request:** 
    Is the landing page from which you will be able to request assistance from our support services starting Public Preview announcement.


## Work with your data and schema

On the left side of the Azure Data Studio window, expand the node [Servers]:
![Screenshot of Servers node.](/assets/ADS_Jul2020_Servers.jpg)

And click [Add Connection] and fill in the connection details to your Postgres instance:
- **Connection Type:** PostgreSQL
- **Server name:** enter the name of your Postgres instance. For example: postgres01
- **Authentication type:** Password
- **User name:** for example you can use the standard/default postgres admin user name. Note, this field is case sensitive.
- **Password:** you will find the password of the Postgres username in the psql connection string in the output of the __azdata postgres server endpoint -n postgres01__ command
- **Database name:** set the name of the database you want to connect to. You can let it set to __Default__
- **Server group:** you can let it set to __Default__
- **Name (optional):** you can let this blank
- **Advanced:**
    - **Host IP Address:** is the Public IP address of the Kubernetes cluster
    - **Port:** is the port on which your Postgres instance is listening. You can find this port at the end of the the psql connection string in the output of the __azdata postgres server endpoint -n postgres01__ command. This is not the port 30080 on which Kubernetes is listening and that you entered when connecting to the Azure Data Controller in Azure Data Studio.
    - **Other parameters:** They should be self explicit, you can live with the default/blank values they appear with.

Click **[OK] and [Connect]** to connect to your server.

Once connected, several experiences are available:
- **New query**
- **New Notebook**
- **Expand the display of your server and browse/work on the objects inside your database**
- **...**

Stay tune for more dashboards and richer experiences as we continuously and incrementally augment them.
