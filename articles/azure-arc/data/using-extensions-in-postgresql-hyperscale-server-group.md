# Scenario: Using PostgreSQL extensions

PostgreSQL is at its best when you use it with extensions. In fact, a key element of our own Hyperscale functionality is the Microsoft-provided `citus` extension that is installed by default, which allows PostgreSQL to transparently shard data across multiple nodes.

In this guide we'll look at two additional extensions:

- [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/)
- [pg_cron](https://github.com/citusdata/pg_cron)
- [plv8](https://plv8.github.io/#plv8)
- [`timescale`](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb)

## The PostGIS extension

We can enable the PostGIS extension on an existing server group, or create a new one with the extension already enabled:

```console
azdata postgres server create -n <name of your postgresql server group> -ns <name of the namespace> --extensions <extension names>

#Example:
azdata postgres server create -n pg2 -ns arc -w 2 --extensions postgis
```

Now, let's go through a PostGIS example. We'll start by getting some [sample data](http://duspviz.mit.edu/tutorials/intro-postgis/) from the MITâ€™s Department of Urban Studies & Planning. 

> [!NOTE]
> You may need to run `apt-get install unzip` to install unzip when using the VM for testing.

```console
wget http://duspviz.mit.edu/_assets/data/intro-postgis-datasets.zip
unzip intro-postgis-datasets.zip
```

Let's connect to our database, and create the PostGIS extension:

```console
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you would like to use one of the extensions in the postgis package (for example postgis_raster, postgis_topology, postgis_sfcgal, fuzzystrmatch...) you need to first create the postgis extension and then create the other extension. For instance: CREATE EXTENSION postgis; CREATE EXTENSION postgis_raster;

And create the schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE coffee_shops (
  id serial NOT NULL,
  name character varying(50),
  address character varying(50),
  city character varying(50),
  state character varying(50),
  zip character varying(10),
  lat numeric,
  lon numeric,
  geom geometry(POINT,4326)
);
CREATE INDEX coffee_shops_gist ON coffee_shops USING gist (geom);
```

Now, we can combine PostGIS with the scaled functionality, by making the coffee_shops table distributed:

```sql
SELECT create_distributed_table('coffee_shops', 'id');
```

Let's load some data:

```console
\copy coffee_shops(id,name,address,city,state,zip,lat,lon) from cambridge_coffee_shops.csv CSV HEADER;
```

And fill the `geom` field with the correctly encoded latitude and longitude in the PostGIS `geometry` data type:

```sql
UPDATE coffee_shops SET geom = ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(lon,lat),4326);
```

Now we can list the coffee shops closest to MIT (77 Massachusetts Ave at 42.359055, -71.093500):

```sql
SELECT name, address FROM coffee_shops ORDER BY geom <-> ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(-71.093500,42.359055),4326);
```

## The pg_cron extension

Let's enable `pg_cron` on our PostgreSQL server group, including PostGIS:

```console
azdata postgres server update -n pg2 -ns arc --extensions postgis,pg_cron
```

> [!NOTE]
> This will restart the nodes and install the additional extensions, which may take 2 - 3 minutes.

We can now connect again, and create the `pg_cron` extension:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_cron;
```

For test purposes, lets make a table `the_best_coffee_shop` that takes a random name from our earlier `coffee_shops` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE the_best_coffee_shop(name text);
```

We can use `cron.schedule` plus a few SQL statements, to get a random table name (notice the use of a temporary table to store a distributed query result), and store it in `the_best_coffee_shop`:

```sql
SELECT cron.schedule('* * * * *', $$
  TRUNCATE the_best_coffee_shop;
  CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE tmp AS SELECT name FROM coffee_shops ORDER BY random() LIMIT 1;
  INSERT INTO the_best_coffee_shop SELECT * FROM tmp;
  DROP TABLE tmp;
$$);
```

And now, once a minute, we'll get a different name:

```sql
SELECT * FROM the_best_coffee_shop;
```

```console
      name
-----------------
 B & B Snack Bar
(1 row)
```

See the [pg_cron README](https://github.com/citusdata/pg_cron) for full details on the syntax.

## The plv8 extension

PLV8 is a trusted JavaScript language extension for PostgreSQL. 

PLV8 works well with:
+ stored procedures
+ triggers
+ most versions of PostgreSQL
+ works best with 9.1 and above
+ works with 10.0 and 11

For more information, see the documentation of the plv8 extension [here](https://plv8.github.io/#plv8).

The plv8 extension is already installed on your Arc system. To install it in your PostgreSQL database, connect with psql and run the command:

```console
CREATE EXTENSION plv8;
```

As it completes successfully, it will return:

```console
CREATE EXTENSION
```

To verify that the installation was indeed successful, run:

```console
SELECT plv8_version();
```

It will return

```console
 plv8_version
--------------
 2.3.14
(1 row)
```

Optionally you can run

```console
SELECT * FROM pg_extension;
```

to list the extensions created in your PostgreSQL instance.

## The `timescaledb` extension

TimescaleDB is an open-source database designed to make SQL scale for time-series data. For more information, see the documentation of the `timescaledb` extension [here](https://github.com/timescale/`timescaledb`).

The `timescaledb` extension is installed in your Arc system. To preload it, run the below command. This command restarts your PostgreSQL server so you should make sure to run it when you can take this short downtime:

```console
azdata postgres server update -n <insert your PostgreSQL server name> --extensions timescaledb
```

After your PostgreSQL instance is restarted, connect to it with psql for instance and create the extension:

```console
CREATE EXTENSION timescaledb;
```

The results will show the `timescaledb` welcome email in the output in your psql session:
You can also run:

```console
SELECT * FROM pg_extension;
```

to list the extensions that have been created in your PostgreSQL instance.
