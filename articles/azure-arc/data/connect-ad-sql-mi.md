# Connect to AD-integrated Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance

This article describes how to connect to Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance endpoints deployed in Active Directory (AD) manual mode. Before you proceed, make sure you have an AD-integrated Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance.

See [Tutorial â€“ Deploy AD-integrated Azure Arc-enabled data services in manual mode](../deploy-active-directory-manual-mode.md) to deploy a Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance in Active Directory (AD) Authentication mode. 

## Connect to Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance 

From your domain joined Windows-based or Linux-based client machine, you can use `sqlcmd` utility, or open [SQL Server Management Studio](/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) or [Azure Data Studio (ADS)](sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio) to connect to the Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance using AD authentication.

Connect to Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance instance from Linux/Mac OS

```bash
kinit <username>@<domain name>
sqlcmd -S <DNS name for master instance>,31433 -E
 ```
 
## Connect to SQL MI instance from Windows

```bash
sqlcmd -S <DNS name for master instance>,31433 -E
```
