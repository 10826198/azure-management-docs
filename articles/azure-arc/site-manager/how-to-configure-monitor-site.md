# Monitor sites in Azure Arc

Sites within Azure Arc aren't able to have monitoring set up on the site overall. Instead, customers can set up alerts and monitoring for supported resources within a site. Once alerts are set up and triggered depending on the alert criteria, site manager makes the resource alert status visible within the Azure Arc site manager (preview) pages.

## Prerequisites

* Azure portal access
* Internet connectivity
* Subscription
* Resource group or subscription with at-least one resource for sites that supports alerts

## Configure monitoring and alerts for sites in Azure Arc

To configure monitoring and alerts for sites in Azure Arc, follow the below steps.

1. Navigate to Azure Monitor by searching for **monitor** within the Azure portal. Select **Monitor** as shown.

1. On the **Monitor** overview, select **Alerts** in either the navigation menu or the boxes shown in the primary screen.

1. On  the **Alerts** page, you can manage existing alerts or create new ones.

   Select **Alert rules** to see all of the alerts currently in effect in your subscription.

   Select **Create** to create an alert rule for a specific resource. If a resource is managed as part of a site, any alerts triggered via its rule appear in the site manager overview.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-configure-monitor-site/create-alert-monitor.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Create and Alert rules actions on the Alerts page.":::

By having either existing alert rules or creating a new alert rule, once the rule is in place for resources supported by Azure Arc site monitor, any alerts that are trigger on that resource will be visible on the sites overview tab.
