# Quickstart: Creating a site in Azure Arc site manager
 

The purpose of this quickstart is to enable starting with Azure Arc site manager and guides on how to create a initial site for resources currently grouped within a single resource group. In this quickstart you will create your first site. Once you create your first Arc site, you will be ready to view your resources within Arc, and conduct actions that depend on the specific resources, such as viewing Inventory, Connectivity status, Updates, and Alerts.

For current status on which resources support what functions within Arc sites, please view the [Azure Arc site manager overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/products/azure-arc/site-manager/overview).

Additionally, if you don't have a service subscription, create a free trial account in Azure [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

## Prerequisites

* Azure Portal Access
* Internet Connectivity
* Subscription
* Resource Group or Subscription with at least 1 compatible resource type for Site (note: it will be beneficial to try to name the resource group a similar name to the real site function, for the example of this article, the resource group will be named "California")

Navigate to Azure Arc site manager the via "Azure Arc" [pane](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_HybridCompute/AzureArcCenterBlade) in Azure in which "Site manager" will be displayed on the left side.

    *Note:* Deleting a site does not affect the resources or the resource group and subscription in its scope. After a site is deleted, the resources of that site cannot be viewed or managed from site manager.
