# Quickstart: Creating a site in Azure Arc site manager
 

The purpose of this quickstart is to enable starting with Azure Arc site manager and guides on how to create an initial site for resources currently grouped within a single resource group. In this quickstart, you create your first site. Once you create your first Arc site, you're ready to view your resources within Arc, and conduct actions that depend on the specific resources, such as viewing Inventory, Connectivity status, Updates, and Alerts.

For current status on which resources support what functions within Arc sites, view the [Azure Arc site manager overview](overview.md).

Additionally, if you don't have a service subscription, create a free trial account in Azure [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

## Prerequisites

* Azure portal Access
* Internet Connectivity
* Subscription
* Resource Group or Subscription with at least one compatible resource type for Site (note: it's beneficial to try to name the resource group a similar name to the real site function, for the example of this article, the resource group is named **California**)

## Open Azure Arc site manager

Navigate to Azure Arc site manager the via **Azure Arc** [pane](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_HybridCompute/AzureArcCenterBlade) in Azure in which **Site manager** will be displayed on the left side.

2. Fill in the details for your first site. While these details may change, at the time of this article the required details are:
    * Site scope: subscription or resource group.
     *Note:* The scope can be defined only at the time of creating a site and can't be modified later. By defining the scope for a site, all the resources in the scope can be viewed and managed from site manager.
    * Site name: custom name for site.
    * Display name: custom display name for site.
    * Subscription: subscription for the site to be created under.
    * Address: Physical address for a site.
3. Once these details are provided, select **Review + create** and you're brought to a summary page to review and confirm the site details prior to creation.

    *Note:* Deleting a site doesn't affect the resources or the resource group and subscription in its scope. After a site is deleted, the resources of that site can't be viewed or managed from site manager.
    *Note:* A new site can be created for the resource group or the subscription after the original site is deleted.
