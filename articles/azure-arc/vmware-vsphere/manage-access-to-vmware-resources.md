# Manage access to VMware resources through Azure Role-based Access Control

In this article, you'll learn how to use the built-in user roles to manage access to VMware resources through Azure Role-based Access Control.

## Azure Arc VMware user roles

The following table lists the user roles used to manage the granular access to Arc-enabled VMware vSphere resources through Azure Role-based Access Control:

| **User Role** | **Description**|
| --- | --- |
| Azure Arc VMware solution administrator role | Provides permissions to perform all the possible operations for the *Microsoft.ConnectedVMwarevSphere* resource provider. This role must be assigned to users or groups that are managing the deployment of Azure Arc-enabled VMware vSphere. |
| Azure Arc VMware private clouds onboarding role | Provides permissions to provision all the required resources for onboarding and deboarding vCenter instances to Azure. |
| Azure Arc VMware solution private cloud user role | Gives the user permission to use the Arc-enabled vSphere resources that are accessible through Azure. This role must be assigned to any users or groups that need to deploy, update, or delete VMs. </br></br> We recommend assigning this role at the individual resource pool (host or cluster), virtual network, or template that you want the user to deploy VMs with. |
| Azure Arc VMware solution VM contributor role | Gives the user permission to perform all VMware VM operations. This role must be assigned to any users or groups that need to deploy, update, or delete VMs. </br></br> We recommend assigning this role at the subscription level or resource group you want the user to deploy VMs with.|

[Create your own Azure custom roles](/articles/role-based-access-control/custom-roles-portal.md) if the Azure built-in roles don't meet the specific needs of your organization.
