  #customer intent: As an Azure user with sufficient permissions, I want to manage support requests in the Azure portal so that I can efficiently address and resolve issues related to my Azure services.

  Manage an Azure support request

introduction: |
  After you
  [create an Azure support request](how-to-create-azure-support-request.md), you
  can manage it in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

  > [!TIP]
  > You can create and manage requests programmatically by using the
  > [Azure support ticket REST API](/rest/api/support) or
  > [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/azure-cli-support-request). Additionally, you can
  > view open requests, reply to your support engineer, or edit the severity of
  > your ticket in the
  > [Azure mobile app](https://azure.microsoft.com/get-started/azure-portal/mobile-app/).

  To manage a support request, you must have the
  [Owner](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner),
  [Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor), or
  [Support Request Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#support-request-contributor)
  role at the subscription level. To manage a support request that was created
  without a subscription, you must be an
  [Admin](../../active-directory/roles/permissions-reference.md).

      Allow collection of advanced diagnostic information
    summary: |
      When you create a support request, you can select **Yes** or **No** in the
      **Advanced diagnostic information** section. This option determines
      whether Azure support can gather
      [diagnostic information](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/support-diagnostic-information-collection/)
      such as
      [log files](how-to-create-azure-support-request.md#advanced-diagnostic-information-logs)
      from your Azure resources that can potentially help resolve your issue.
      Azure support can only access advanced diagnostic information if your case
      was created through the Azure portal and you granted permission to allow
      it.

      To change your **Advanced diagnostic information** selection after the
      request is created:
    steps:
      - |
        On the **All support requests** page, select the support request.

      - |
        On the **Support Request** page, select **Advanced diagnostic information** near the top of the screen.

      - |
        Select **Yes** or **No**, then select **Submit**.

      Upload files
    summary: |
      You can use the file upload option to upload a diagnostic file, such as a
      [browser trace](../capture-browser-trace.md) or any other files that you
      think are relevant to a support request.
