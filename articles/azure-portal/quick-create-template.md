# Quickstart: Create a dashboard in the Azure portal by using an Azure Resource Manager template

The Azure portal is a web-based, unified console where you manage Azure subscriptions and resources. A dashboard is a focused and organized view of your cloud resources in the Azure portal. This quickstart focuses on the process of deploying a Resource Manager template to create a dashboard in the Azure portal. The dashboard shows the performance of a virtual machine (VM), as well as some static information and links.

[!INCLUDE [About Azure Resource Manager](../../includes/resource-manager-quickstart-introduction.md)]

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Create a virtual machine

The dashboard you create in the next part of this quickstart requires an existing VM. Create a VM by following these steps:

1. In the Azure portal, select Cloud Shell.

    ![Select Cloud shell from the Azure portal ribbon](media/quick-create-template/cloud-shell.png)

1. At the command prompt, enter the following command.

    ```powershell
    New-AzResourceGroup -Name SimpleWinVmResourceGroup -Location EastUS
    ```

    ![Copy a command into the command prompt](media/quick-create-template/command-prompt.png)

1. At the command prompt, enter the following command.

    ```powershell
    New-AzVm `
        -ResourceGroupName "SimpleWinVmResourceGroup" `
        -Name "SimpleWinVm" `
        -Location "East US" 
    ```

1. Enter a username and password for the VM. This is a new user name and password; it's not, for example, the account you use to sign in to Azure. For more information, see [username requirements](..articles/virtual-machines/windows/faq#what-are-the-username-requirements-when-creating-a-vm) and [password requirements](..articles/virtual-machines/windows/faq#what-are-the-password-requirements-when-creating-a-vm).

The VM deployment typically takes a few minutes. After it completes, move on to the next section.

## Create an Azure portal dashboard

<!-- The second H2 must start with "Create a". For example,  'Create a Key Vault', 'Create a virtual machine', etc. -->

## Review the template

<!-- The first sentence must be the following sentence. Use a link to the quickstart gallery that begins with https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/.  -->

The template used in this quickstart is from [Azure Quickstart Templates]().

<!-- After the first sentence, add a JSON code fence that links to the quickstart template. Customers have provided feedback that they prefer to see the whole template. We recommend you include the entire template in your article. If your template is too long to show in the quickstart (more than 250 lines), you can instead add a sentence that says - `The template for this article is too long to show here. To view the template, see [azuredeploy.json](link to template's raw output)`.

The syntax for the code fence is: -->

:::code language="json" source="~/quickstart-templates/<TEMPLATE NAME>/azuredeploy.json" range="000-000" highlight="000-000":::

<!-- For visibility, use highlight for the template's "resources": section. -->

<!-- After the JSON code fence, a list of each resourceType from the JSON must exist with a link to the template reference starting with /azure/templates. List the resourceType links in the same order as in the template.

For example:

* [**Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults**](/azure/templates/microsoft.keyvault/vaults): create an Azure key vault.
* [**Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets**](/azure/templates/microsoft.keyvault/vaults/secrets): create an key vault secret.

The URL usually appears as, for example, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/templates/Microsoft.Network/2019-11-01/loadBalancers for loadbalancer of Microsoft.Network. Remove the API version from the URL so that the URL redirects to the latest version.
-->

* [Azure resource type](link to the template reference)
* [Azure resource type](link to the template reference)

<!-- List additional quickstart templates. For example: [Azure Quickstart Templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/?resourceType=Microsoft.Keyvault&pageNumber=1&sort=Popular).
Notice the resourceType and sort elements in the URL.
-->

## Deploy the template

<!--
 One of the following options must be included:

  - **CLI**: In an Azure CLI Interactive code fence must contain **az deployment group create**. For example:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    read -p "Enter a project name that is used for generating resource names:" projectName &&
    read -p "Enter the location (i.e. centralus):" location &&
    templateUri="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/101-storage-account-create/azuredeploy.json" &&
    resourceGroupName="${projectName}rg" &&
    az group create --name $resourceGroupName --location "$location" &&
    az deployment group create --resource-group $resourceGroupName --template-uri  $templateUri
    echo "Press [ENTER] to continue ..." &&
    read
    ```

  - **PowerShell**: In an Azure PowerShell Interactive code fence must contain **New-AzResourceGroupDeployment**. For example:

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    $projectName = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter a project name that is used for generating resource names"
    $location = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter the location (i.e. centralus)"
    $templateUri = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/101-storage-account-create/azuredeploy.json"

    $resourceGroupName = "${projectName}rg"

    New-AzResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroupName -Location "$location"
    New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -TemplateUri $templateUri

    Read-Host -Prompt "Press [ENTER] to continue ..."
    ```

  - **Portal**: Use a button with description **Deploy to Azure**, and the shared image ../media/template-deployments/deploy-to-azure.svg. The template link starts with https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/.
  
    ```markdown
    [![Deploy to Azure](../media/template-deployments/deploy-to-azure.svg)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-quickstart-templates%2Fmaster%2F101-key-vault-create%2Fazuredeploy.json)
    ```

    The shared button image is in [GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs-pr/blob/master/articles/media/template-deployments/deploy-to-azure.svg). To find more information about this deployment option, see [Use a deployment button to deploy templates from GitHub repository](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-to-azure-button).
 -->

## Review deployed resources

<!-- You can also use the title "Validate the deployment". -->

<!-- Include a portal screenshot of the resources or use interactive Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell commands to show the deployed resources. -->

You can either use the Azure portal to check the deployed resources, or use Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell script to list the deployed resources.

## Clean up resources

<!-- Include a paragraph that explains how to delete unneeded resources. Add a portal screenshot or use interactive Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell commands to clean up the resources. -->

When no longer needed, delete the resource group, which deletes the resources in the resource group.

<!--

Choose Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or Azure portal to delete the resource group.

Here are the samples for Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell:

```azurecli-interactive
echo "Enter the Resource Group name:" &&
read resourceGroupName &&
az group delete --name $resourceGroupName &&
echo "Press [ENTER] to continue ..."
```

```azurepowershell-interactive
$resourceGroupName = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter the Resource Group name"
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroupName
Write-Host "Press [ENTER] to continue..."
```

-->
