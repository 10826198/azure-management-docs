# Azure portal GDPR compliance overview

In May 2018, a European privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), takes effect. The GDPR imposes new rules on companies, government agencies, non-profits, and other organizations that offer goods and services to people in the European Union (EU), or that collect and analyze data tied to EU residents. The GDPR applies no matter where you are located. 
Microsoft products and services are available today to help you meet the GDPR requirements. Read more about Microsoft Privacy policy at [Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter).

The Azure portal creates or captures the following data, which can contain EUII.

* Azure portal dashboards
* User settings like favorite subscriptions or directories, and last logged in directory
* Themes and customizations

GDPR compliance for Azure portal is available from the Azure portal settings menu. You can:

* Export all settings
* Delete all user settings and private dashboards

We strongly recommend that you export and review your data before you delete your settings and private dashboards. If you delete your data, it can be time consuming to rebuild the dashboards and re-add your customizations.

## Export or delete your portal settings

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com).
2. On the top right of the portal, select **Settings**.

    | Setting | description|
    |---|---|
    | **Export all settings**| Create a .json file that contains your user settings. The file contains settings like the your dashboard theme.|
    |**Delete all settings and private dashboards**| Deletes all links to private dashboards and other user customizations you've made to the portal dashboard.|
